"Perfect for face mask ear loops! I took a chance on this elastic because I couldn’t find any other. So glad I did! Firm cord that cuts and ties easily, and has just enough give to be comfortable, but strong enough to hold a mask firmly to your face. I couldn’t be more pleased and so’s my family who are wearing the masks I make them! Love this elastic cord!",5,5

"Hair damagers for sale.. One of the jagged white ends got caught in my hair and I gave up. Taking it out of my hair was more than half a nightmare. I returned these.<br /><br />These are a mm wider in diameter than advertised, FYI. See pics. One pic shows a blurry, jagged white end piece (sorry it's the best pic I could get!). One pic show the item side by side with the once popular grey loop rods (with a known diameter of 8mm). This item is visually larger in diameter.<br /><br />I only used one long enough to get it stuck and unstuck. I don't know how they will work exposed to perm chemicals.<br /><br />It feels like I could sleep in them if I wouldn't have to shave my head the next day.<br /><br />The end piece is not detachable. The hair tangles around the end piece.<br /><br />One more thing, this is my second attempt at ordering. I got a larger size on accident the first time, although it came in the mail quickly. I returned those and now I got these 4 days later. I ordered the blue-colored rods to be delivered to me. I was told that the color is random, the size is what matters. I measured the new rod diameter and it's approx. 9mm diameter.<br /><br />Instead of these, I ordered small, yellow, straight, plastic rods. They are smaller and easier to handle than this product and also the grey loop rods. It's hard to find a small diameter in a rod.",1,1

Dries hair faster This brush works really well. It has slightly longer bristles which grab the hair securely so it is easier to style. And the ceramic barrel very efficiently helps dry the hair faster.,5,5
"Lightly Cucumber Scented and Easy on the Skin It's rare to find a skin product that doesn't irritate me one way or another, which often leads to me having dry skin because of my reluctance to use lotion, but this product has changed that.<br /><br />One of the most pleasant things about this lotion is its fresh cucumber scent; I'm not sure why this isn't clearly indicated on the package, but it's delightful!<br /><br />This lotion goes on smooth, and it's not sticky or clumpy at all. It dries within just a few minutes. It's a great help in keeping my legs happy when shaving daily during the summer, and the scent is summery too!<br /><br />I like their lip balm a bit, but it's the body lotion and shaving cream that I can't get through summer without. I love it!",5,5

"does moisturize Used this for a few treatments, what I notice, my scalp is softer and my hair has some more moisture and a little more volume and looks healthier, Didn't notice a difference with flakes or dandruff( but I really only have issues with this in the colder months) .

Not true to the real color I have purchased this nail polish 3 times as it is my all time favorite. The color sent was not at all the same color as what I bought in the salons. Not nearly as nice and no sparkle. Honestly I almost wonder if label was incorrect.,1,5

"This is a great little trimmer with some guard attachments for trimming a ... This is a great little trimmer with some guard attachments for trimming a beard. Although it's not very heavy duty&#34;. Meaning it probably couldn't cut coarse beard hair. But I only do a few men's cuts a week with trimming around the ears and hairline at the nape. It works just fine for my needs. I have to go over it a couple of times, but it will trim close enough. It's cool that it's so lightweight and portable with batteries. I keep a couple batteries in my salon cupboard so if it runs out of juice I'm not stuck. I'm thinking about getting another one for home to clean up my husbands hairline between haircuts.",4,5

"Excellent lather, performance and scent; fussy bottle I'm impressed with this face soap. It's very thick and silky, and only a very small amount is needed to get good results. That's especially welcome to find out given the price for a pretty small bottle. It lathers up well and does a good job of cleaning without leaving my skin overly dry. It is a bit more intensive than other face soaps, so my face does feel a little 'tight' after using it. However, it's not excessive, and well worth it given how well this soap cleans if you have an oily complexation. The charcoal makes the soap dark, but it's not as jet-black as other charcoal soaps I've used. It's more of a deep gray.<br /><br />The scent is also quite nice. It's a medium/light intensity and has sort of an after-shave smell to it. The scent does not linger much at all after rinsing. While I tend to prefer unscented soaps, this scent is pleasant and enjoyable.<br /><br />The only con is the bottle. Getting the pump nozzle to pop up was a chore since the retaining ring the pump head screws into also rotates, making it a struggle to get the nozzle to pop up. I eventually got it working, but have noticed that the pump leaks at the stem. It's a small leak, but it adds up over a few days to make a mess on the bottle and waste soap. Given the price, the pump mechanism should have been of better quality.<br /><br />One star down for the bottle issues, but otherwise, it's a very enjoyable soap to use.",4,3
"NOT AT ALL PLEASED To the point,<br /> The wigs color was more copper than what I thought. That could have just be because in the pictures it does seem to have dark undertones but there are none. 26 inches I beg to differ, I think this wig was about a 22 inches. It had no weight to it. It was over processed and shed. the hairs coming off at the actual bulb part, where they stitch it on to the cap and it was so thin towards the bottom I'm guessing because it was over processed while being colored. I have never left a bad review but after spending almost 200 dollars I figured I'd at least give someone the heads up before they go in on this wig. Blonde colored wigs are more expensive, I understand because they have to dye them, but this one just lost the entire mark. and just FYI the wig cap is biigggggggg.....I will not be returning it. I'll cut my losses and stick to my normal brands. I re-dyed it, re styled it and even cut it. I hate returning, so I will use it one of my, home wigs. Very disappointed.",2,3
"Amazing Product! I waited to write a review on this product because, at first, I was not sure about it. The product is well packaged and easy to use. I am 54 years old and after the first night I used it, I woke up the next morning and my face was red and a bit swollen. At first I thought maybe I was having an allergic reaction. I noticed after one use my skin was much smoother, as if the top layer of dead skin came off. I gave my face a few days of a break, as this product seems to be a strong one, and reluctantly tried it again. I did not have the same reaction with the redness and swelling. So I kept using this product, but as it is a strong one, I use it only 2-3 times a week. After about a couple of weeks using it, I discovered all kinds of undesirable things coming out of the pores of my skin, I developed little pussy sores and pimples, but the pimples were not like the regular pimple, these were deep and what came out was really think and sometimes hard. Instead of having what I thought was an allergic reaction, I think this product was pulling impurities out of my skin and detoxing it. I also had a couple of small, sebaceous cysts on my forehead and after about a month of using this product, they were gone! I was told by a plastic surgeon the only way to get rid of them was surgery but I didn't want the scar on my forehead so never had anything done about them, I had them for years. To this day, the cysts are gone. My skin no longer reacts as if impurities are being pulled out. There is still a small amount of burning on the nights I use this product but if I follow it up with argon oil or rose hip oil, the burning goes away. I've noticed my skin is a firmer, smoother in texture, very soft, and the skin tone is more even. Although I got amazing results, this product may be overpriced considering it is only ascorbic acid. Maybe the products in the activator justifies the price but as I'm not an expert on ingredients, I'm not sure.",5,5
"Deep Cleaning Face Mask Are you looking for the ultimate in squeaky clean skin? This citrus-based mask cleanses pores like a dream, removing oil and dirt while softening skin too. You will need to moisturize after using this as your skin will feel a little tighter and drier. If you have oily problem skin, this will impress. Leave it on 8 minutes for the best effect. The texture of this mask is a little like firm whipping cream instead of clay. It is easy to apply and remove with a little extra care. You will immediately notice how absolutely purified your pores look. Impressive!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",5,5

"Good opportunity to try a lot of different products Review for: Burt's Bees Baby Bath Time Kit With Ultra Gentle Lotion, 1 Count<br /><br />I have been a fan of Burt’s Bees products for years. I welcomed the opportunity to try this assortment.<br /><br />I found the bubble bath to be a good product for my household. Lots of bubbles, no scent that I could detect and an easy to use dispenser. The body wash/shampoo is fine as a body wash and I love the foam dispenser. It works ok for an infant as shampoo but I don’t like it as shampoo for a toddler with more hair. The wipes are great and I like the small package so they stay moist longer. The lotion is quite thin as most baby lotion is so you have to be careful when opening or dispensing it because you can find yourself with way more than you wanted very quickly. I also could not discern any scent on the lotion. The oil I only use to pour just a tad into a bath so soften and moisten the skin. You do have to be careful not to put too much in or the tub will become a slip and slide.<br /><br />Overall: Nice products, not perfect but would make a nice gift, comes in a gift box.",4,5

"Great product and good price for my ash blond curly hair I love this stuff. Picked some up at the &#34;red circle&#34; store on sale to try it out. Much better than the L-----l product and doesn't have that cheap perfume smell. I have ash blond very curly hair (gradually graying) and it looks better than it ever has. After the cowash, I always apply about 1-2 tsp of any heavy conditioner and leave it in my hair. Wish I had found out about the cowash option years ago. I find products for African American hair work very well for me. This product is so reasonable and I plan to try some of the other Pantene products in this line as soon as I use my old stuff up.",5,5

"Nice variety, seem to be durable At this price, this set is a good value in terms of quantity, variety of styles and sturdiness. I've only had them for a few days so I can't say for sure that they're going to be durable, but I did slam them repeatedly on my tile floors with far more force than with the impact of simply falling, and they're still in tact.<br /><br />I have thin hair and the clips grasp nicely and wear comfortably. They open wide enough that I'm sure they'll work for thick hair, too.<br /><br />The colors were a little off, at least on my monitor. The one that looks gold on my screen is actually a light tan. I will probably never wear it out of the house. It looks awful with my red hair and I can't think of many outfits it would match either. That's why the set loses a star for me. The brownish one is lighter than pictured, too.",4,3

"Deep cleaning as described 4 stars because it pulled my skin off on the sensitive crease on side of my nose. Just be careful if you have a tough spot upon removing.

Just like the nail salon Works just like ones in the nail salon. I am sooo happy to not have to go to the nail salon again. Make sure you rub them down with alcohol after so they don't feel sticky. I also suggest getting a gel polish starter kit with it so you have a base and top coat. I also found it works best if i buff my nail bed and wipe them down with polish remover first to remove oils and to have a rough surface to stick to.,5,5
"Excellent Product and company It is a very good product, but I need something a little stronger; therefore, I ordered the Jessner Peel. I think this is good for people with sensitive skin. I like the accessibility of the company. I did not need to contact them, but the literature that you download has all contact information on it.

"waste of money First of all, this clip is difficult to put in. After I got the elastic securely in place, the silver piece kept breaking off! So I had to keep removing the elastic from my hair & re-attaching the piece to it. Also, as my hair is not very thick, it didn't stay up in place, but kept sagging down & just looking very awkward, so I decided this was not the hair clip for me!<br />I gave up & gave it *and the gold-toned one* to my daughter, whose hair is much thicker than my own.<br />Also, on another note, the clips took forever to arrive; I may as well have shopped elsewhere to begin with!",1,1

"Cute design and not too tight These are super cute, especially the striped one I got. I love that it's a two pack because I was able to give my mom the other one since we both dye our hair. We have curly hair so you don't want to wash it every single day or it turns into a frizzy mess. These fit both our different head sizes and the elastic was good. It was a little tighter on my bigger head, but honestly that probably helped keep more water out haha. Didn't have any trouble with them, they did keep water out and the material dries off fairly quickly after so I can put it back in the cabinet before bed time.",5,5

"Skin Feels Soft & Fairly Comfortable, No Greasy Residue-Moderately Strong Perfume & TEA (3.5 Stars) Spanature Olive Hand & Body Lotion comes with 4 travel size lotions (individually boxed for gifting) in a 2.53 oz size that’s more than twice the size of the tiny 1 oz hand creams I usually buy for my purse. I go through lotion and cream fast as I use it every time I wash my hands and more, so I like this bigger size as it lasts longer but is still a compact size for my purse. It’s also big enough for a long weekend away from home.<br /><br />This is a lightweight mineral oil based lotion that absorbs quickly and doesn’t leave any greasy residue. It has a pleasant feel and adds just enough moisture to make my dry hands soft and fairly comfortable. I do prefer more hydration, but I also have dry rather than normal skin. The fragrance is moderately strong and sweet. It’s okay used just on my hands, but it would be too strong for me if used as an all over body lotion.<br /><br />I dislike that this lotion has controversial Triethanolamine (TEA). The FDA designates it as safe for limited use (but bans it from hand sanitizer), but EWG rates it as a moderate health risk (allergen). And TEA can play a role in the formation of dangerous nitrosamines when combined with certain preservatives. I can’t assess that issue in this or any specific products, so I just try to avoid TEA. That aside, I like this lotion pretty well for limited use. 3.5 Stars.<br /><br />Ingredients: Water, Mineral Oil, Propylene Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Polysorbate 60, Sorbitan Stearate, Stearic Acid, Olea Europaea (Olive), Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Sodium Polyacrylate, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Trideceth-6, Dimethicone, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Sodium Hyaluronate, Disodium EDTA, Allantoin, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Fragrance.",4,5
Use as an Ingredient in Body Butter I recently made myself a body butter and used this oil in place of the almond oil the recipe called for. It worked really well. I will say however that this one bottle seems to be 125 ml as it filled up a half a cup. Using this in the body butter made the butter very luxurious. I now use it nightly on my hands and feet. You could also use this as a massage oil. I'm finding this really does make my skin look younger. After about a week you may notice a difference too.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review<br /><br />I received one free bottle for review purposes. This review is my honest opinion.,5,5

"So Good My Girlfriend Stole It From Me - Very Good Facial Cleansing Brush I'm confident more women than men get this brush and it is a little feminine for my style but I wanted to try something to see if I could improve my skin condition. I've only recently started to use a cleansing brush as part of my evening routine after watching the success my daughter had using one on her skin. I decided to give this a try and found it very good ... it was so good in fact that my girlfriend stole it from me!<br /><br />The brush feels very well manufactured and the design is aesthetically pleasing. I got the brush handle and all of the brush wet and had no issues. I didn't learn until later that some brushes recommend you don't get anything other than the brush head wet. I treated this kind of like I treat a razor. I did not submerge it nor would I. The brush definitely loosens up dirt and oil on your face quickly. I felt the LumaRx had a significant power for scrubbing my face.<br /><br />The brush comes with multiple brush attachments, to be honest I haven't completely figured out which attachment is best for what job so I use the softer brush. I have used this a few times in the morning before shaving and it does a very good job of helping me get a much closer shave, I believe because it deeply moisturizes the whiskers and helps them stand up better for a clean cut.<br /><br />The brush comes with a travel bag and charger, the heads are very easy to change and are durable. Charging is quick and I've used it more than a dozen times on one charge.<br /><br />I think I must have talked too much about how much I liked this brush so my girlfriend decided to start using it and I'm afraid I'm not going to see it again!",5,5

"Great oil for massages and salt scrubs I purchased this apricot oil specifically to use for salt scrubs I make with essential oils for use on hands or during a shower or bath. Apricot oil is one of my favorites to use in them because it isn't super thick and greasy and leaves just the right amount of moisture after you dry yourself off after using it in a scrub. Additionally, it also makes a great massage oil. Not a lot of fragrance to it and it works in nice without you having to wash your hands after use. Love it!",5,5

It's not magic like they say - it's okay It's not magic like they say - it's okay. I suppose it's a little better than okay - but I don't love it. I'll use it while I look for something better. Shade matches my skin tone well. I have scars on my chest from a bad infection I have - it covers them okay. Not super impressed but better than nothing. Doesn't seem to stain clothing.,3,3

"My second batch! I bought this with Hydra B5 Gel Advanced Formula, and use it every morning. Over it all I use Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion for dry skin, and it seems to be working very well.<br /><br />I noticed that my face and chest appears firmer, and my neckline has shown improvement as well. I have been getting comments on how refreshed I look.<br /><br />I'm rather cynical about the claims of most product lines, but this one does seem to do what it says it does.<br /><br />Best of all... no pimples after using it!",5,5

"Perfect product I bought this gift set for my cousin who has been struggling to embrace her curly hair. I use these products myself. I used to use Ouidad (way more expensive) and then DevaCurl (less so) until my fragrance allergies caught up with me and I needed to find something that used natural fragrances, not chemical ones.<br /><br />The shampoo really lathers up well and I instantly feel like my hair is more conditioned but not oily. The conditioner is also great. It makes my unruly hair easier to comb and keeps it nice and moisturized. Finally, the thing I go through most quickly after the conditioner is the transitioning milk which I use mostly when my hair is wet but sometimes in combination with [[ASIN:B002T6WBQ4 Deva Curl Mist-Er Right, 12 oz]] when my curls lose definition in-between washes.<br /><br />I have 3b-3c hair. I like that these products don't weigh down my curls like Miss Jessie's products did no matter how little I use. They define my curls and let them stand for themselves. My hair feels really soft but you can't tell there's anything actually in it. This is the perfect product.",5,5

"Velvety feel - creates a matte effect and reduces the appearance of pores and wrinkles. This product has been a 'must have' since I discovered it. When I received my first bottle, I applied to half of my face to see if it made a difference and it really does, in terms of minimizing the appearance of fine lines and pores by creating a matte-like foundation! When the bottle is approaching empty, the product gets crumbly and I tend to discard the bottle before it is completely empty, which is a shame. A couple of tips I've learned about using this product - 1. When spreading the product on your face, spread in the direction that your peach-fuzz facial hairs grow. 2. Keep it away from your brows as it will look crumbly and flaky (like eyebrow dandruff?) if it gets into them. Otherwise it is great and I often use it with no other makeup.",5,5
"Refrigerate For Maximum, Instant Relief This Vaginal Moisturizer - Vulva Balm - USDA Organic Aloe Free & Natural Vaginal Cream - Intimate Skin Cream - Reduce Vaginal Dryness, Itching & Burning - Estrogen Free Treatment - V. Harmony (1) will relieve a multitude of irritations caused by many different issues. One of the main irritations are pads or tampons. Every month, especially for a heavy period, menstrual pads can cause painful irritations, dryness, rashes, pain and itching. Then when you are into menopause, the irritations, dryness, rashes, pain and itching are a hundred times worse, due to heavy periods that can last forever.<br /><br />There are many other issues that can cause constant irritations besides pads and tampons- if you’ve ever had a bad Urinary Tract Infection, where you are urinating frequently in pain, the rashes are unbearable. Having a weak bladder at times where you need a heavier pad or diaper causes more unpleasant rashes. It is so difficult to find a cream that will actually help with severe chafing, dryness, pain, itching and irritations. This V. Harmony Vaginal Moisturizer helps immensely with chafing and dryness. But when it comes to helping with severe rashes, itching and pain- make sure you refrigerate this first before applying, because you will be happy you did. Applying this cold is the best relief ever- the pain goes away immediately. Take the time to refrigerate the jar for maximum, instant relief! 5 STARS.",5,5

"Sparkly and pretty but a bit loose These are just like the picture. Sizable and sturdy, very sparkly, but they don’t stay in thin straight hair. Upon close inspection you can see that some have a looser grip at the end of the pin that doesn’t quite clamp, this it slips from the hair. But thicker, coarse or even curly hair does fine.

"Super soft skin, but oh so messy to use!! This coffee scrub smells divine while dry, and leaves my skin smelling ever so subtly like coffee and cinnamon. Oddly, I don’t really notice the smell in the shower. I love the exfoliation and use it on my entire body. Out of the shower, I feel a mild oil barrier on my skin that I don’t care for. Once I add my normal body shaping cream (Clarins Body Fit), I’m in heaven! The 2 products together leave my skin super cool and tingly for about an hour, followed by crazy soft skin. I don’t actually have a lot of cellulite (thank you Clarins!), but what I do have is less noticeable after just 2 uses. So, what’s not to like? This scrub is so incredibly messy, it’s borderline impractical! Most scrubs are made with sugar or salt crystals held together with some form of oil or gel, and dissolve in the shower. Ground coffee doesn’t dissolve and this scrub is dry, so it literally gets everywhere...like sand from the beach! And worse, I have a walk in shower with white tile floors...coffee stains if it sits too long! As much as I like the way this product smells and improves my skin texture, it’s a pain in my cellulite free backside to clean up! Mixing it with a little water and creating a paste before use helps a little, and thankfully I have a handheld shower to quickly rinse it off my tiled walls and shower door, but I’m constantly concerned it’s going to stain my floor grout. Deep sigh...I soooooo wish this product weren’t so messy!",4,5

Retinol is one of the things that I look for when purchasing night time creams, as I am in my mid thirties and require a little help with the fine lines that I am starting to notice. I don't have a lot but the ones I have are enough to get me very concerned about what skin care products to use. One other thing that I am concerned about is my sensitive skin. I love the Retinol Night Cream by Key West Health and Beauty because it addresses all my concern: help with moisture retention on my face, eradicating what fine lines I have on my face and a formula that will work with my extra sensitive skin.

"Do some blending Product's alright, a little goes along way. also when you get it, or if you get it, test it out on your forehand first. Just because its smooth, therefore it resembles, your cheek. Testing this on the back of your hand, is fine to. i think this is good for light-mediumdark skin tones. The product, is more-or-so like a light glow, giving you a good DEWY finish, and remember it reflects in light, or when you turn your head. So don't be fooled, and apply more than what you actually need, because it might in some lighting not even look like you have any of this on your face. i personally would not purchase this product again, and you could do better, but you can make other uses out of this. some people said that this product was watery....?????????? mine was fine, kinda like the title of the product, whip, but please remember this is just my opinion.",3,3

"Warm Soothing Scent Kama Sutra Treasures of the Sea is an intriguing bath salt with a warm sensuous room enveloping fragrance. One scoop of the salts in a tub of water and you transform everyday bathing into bubbles and water the color of the ocean.<br /><br />The color reminded me of the turquoise waters near the Aiya Napa white caves in Cyprus. The texture of the water turns silky and you may notice your skin is more moisturized from the natural oils, especially the Wheat Germ Oil.<br /><br />While many may see the color as ""Azure"" there is a definite green vs. purple color mingling in the depths of blue and this does contain Algae. The texture of the salt is more like a sand than a salt and the shimmering finely ground blue salt crystals mingle with what looks like tiny pieces of broken marble. Of course, this all dissolves quickly and the bubbles last through the entire bath. In fact, the more you move around, the more bubbles appear.<br /><br />The warm scent soothes the soul and the color is dreamy and the bubbles look like clouds floating across an open sky. A shell of salts is all you need and a beautiful shell is included.<br /><br />I had so much fun taking a bath with these salts, that I ran my husband a bath too. These salts seem to inspire sharing and recently inspired a poem:<br /><br />Bubble Bath<br /><br />Turquoise mystery<br /><br />Opalescent bubbles<br /><br />Scent lingers in the air<br /><br />Water splashing over painted toes<br /><br />Sinking into the soothing warm<br /><br />Soul comfort misplaces cares<br /><br />Troubles dissolved<br /><br />Sinking down the drain<br /><br />The wisdom of silence<br /><br />Bliss of Escape<br /><br />Liquid remedy<br /><br />Immersion in solitude<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",5,3

It includes a full sized LED light, something not all kits do. You get a lot of smaller tools and accessories in this kit and you also get 10 colors of polish as well as well as a top coat and base.<br /><br />The polish itself has a nice consistency and the handles of the brushes are easy to use. They come with the colored dots on tops of the handles. I did remove one star from my review because two of the bottles of polish did not have their lids on tight and my kit arrived with two leaking polish bottles and a mess to clean up.

"Whats the deal with the hype of this? AVOID! Okay so I received this about 6 weeks ago.<br /><br />First impressions:<br />Upon opening my package, I noticed the box was already sort of opened and not sealed... I assumed it's because it is a cheap product. I also noticed that in the serum, I had white clumps which I assumed was due to the freezing temperatures outside at the time. I also noticed this product had a very astringent smell -- similar to alcohol.<br /><br />Usage:<br />I had been using it twice daily after cleansing, toning, and my essence. I am used to using a serum, but this product seriously made my face super red every time I applied it. I assumed it was due to a niacin conversion on my skin, but after a couple weeks, I started breaking out more than ever. I noticed that my skin was completely sensitive, red, and everything would sting my face. I did not think it was this product at first, but after i stopped using this product completely, the redness and sensitivity stopped.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />Do not buy this product. In my case, this product made my skin worse than it has ever been along with being super crazy sensitive. I do not recommend this to anyone, but perhaps I received a bad batch? The lot/manufacturing stamp on the product is ""8LB"" if anyone with the same lot/manufacturing stamp is having a similar issue...<br />However, if you are looking for a niacinamide+zinc formula, I would recommend Revolution Skincare Niacinamide+Zinc from Ulta instead. I have now been using that for about 3 weeks without any of the same issues from the Ordinary.",1,5

I went home and thru it away! Saw Dr Graf on shopping channel promoting her products and bought them, and have used them since! I am 54 years old and no one believes me.

"Has worked well for me (Right about 3.5 stars)<br />As others have mentioned, this trimmer suffers from a bad stand design; you cannot charge it while it's in the stand. Frankly I don't bother with the stand at all; the trimmer and accessories stay in a drawer in my bathroom where they can't gather dust.<br />I mostly use the G250 for nose and ear hair removal. It does a decent job at trimming with this attachment. One noticeable downside for trimming ear hair is the noise: it's just a bit too loud to be comfortable. (Might just be my noise tolerance is low, as I grew up on the edge of a pine forest in Maine.) While at home I trim my beard with a larger, corded Norelco model, but the G250 worked fine performing general trimming on a couple of vacation trips.<br />Other reviewers have mentioned problems with the battery. I'll have to consider myself lucky in this department. I've gotten very good charge retention, with several weekly trimming sessions on each charge.<br />Bottom line: It's got some flaws, but the G250 has worked well for me.",4,4

It's my new go-to for on the road and quickly gives my wavy hair great results! No more shoving a giant hair dryer plus its hard plastic diffuser into an overpacked suitcase.

These contain a piece of loofa stitched very well onto a cloth pad with a piece of elastic over the back to keep on your hand. I didn't realize until recently that loofas are made from the dried insides of gourds. So, no, they're not a product of the sea like a sponge. It's amazing to me that they're able to be stitched so well into cloth. I really like these. I just read that it's possible to machine wash loofa but that you shouldn't put them through the dryer. Eventually, my loofa got moldy from hanging out in the shower so often. I threw it away, but next time I'll know that I can put it through the washing machine before it gets to that state. Luckily, this is a 3-pack.",4,5

"You get your money's worth These rub my eyes in the bad way. They're really rough, and really not that thick. I think you get what you pay for in terms of these. Obviously they still do their job, but I really wish they were softer because I feel like I'm probably getting scratches on my skin even with it soaking wet.",3,1

"Finally something that works! I LOVE this product! I have (embarrassingly) dry and cracked heels. In the summer I would have to spend time every week filing with a course, medium and fine file to get my heels to a place where I wasn't embarrassed to wear flip flops. Even then, it wasn't how I really wanted my heels. After one of the files I used was discontinued I decided to look for something else. I decided that I wanted something with a motor that would really get the job done. Most of the products I found had mediocre to bad reviews until I found this one. I decided to give it a try. Now that I have it I don't think I'll even use a foot file again! It is very easy to use and works to file the skin away with ease. I love the adjustable speed. I keep it about a third of the way up. The first time I used it (with the course disc) I had the speed set higher and my skin became very warm and felt like it was burning to I turned it down to a slower speed. The fine disc I can use at a higher speed. I can file my feel in a few minutes and they look and feel great. I have used it 4 times so far and both of the discs seem like new, so I suspect that I won't need to buy refills for a while. The only suggestion I have it to start at a slow speed and get used to it before using higher speeds to see what you find comfortable and effective the first couple time.",5,5

"Very Good!!! I wasn't really expecting much, but so far, it's been about a month and I already see quite an improvement in my skin. My tone is more even and I noticed the crepe is starting to disappear. The wipes are a nice weight and are well moistened, enough to do both your face and neck. They are handy and easy to use and I don't have to figure anything out, like how much or whatever. I just follow the directions and go. I'm looking forward to long term results.

"Cool and Moisturizing This is definitely a ""cooling"" body wash. It makes my skin tingle and would be excellent in the summer months when you need to bring your body temperature down. The scent is like menthol-eucalyptus, but a bit sweeter. The lather is very thick and smooth, and it rinses away leaving my skin feeling cool and moisturized. The only reason for the 4-star rating is the price. $15 is a bit much for 6 ounces of product.",4,5
"Great product, I love it Great product, I love it. Doesn't make my skin break out, unlike other over the counter items. It's pleasantly smelling, and a little bit goes a long way.",5,5
"Pros & Cons Pros: It warms up and has easy to use settings. It waxes all the hairs you need and easier to use than those other waxers that come in a pot.<br /><br />Cons: It took a very long time for it to heat up. It took around 30-40 minutes to reach 100 degrees which wasn't the max however thats when I took note it takes a very long time for it to heat up. In order to use it, it needs to be plugged in at all times because then it doesn't stay warm.<br /><br />Update: Stopped working after one use. It takes 1 hr to heat up and even then will not fully heat.",2,3
Breaking quickly I like the size (they are very large and thick) and the color and thought these would be great for my long thick hair.<br /><br />I was wrong.

"Finally, a portable hairbrush for my hair. I have thick, wavy hair and need a thick brush. Over a decade ago I discovered that boar bristles work best, but finding one I can take with me was a process. I didn't like those with exposed bristles, so there weren't many options. This is the first folding boar-bristle brush I found.<br /><br />The plastic is light and gives the impression that it isn't of the best quality, but it's survived my backpack just fine. This is a portable brush, so using it requires more strokes through my hair, but that's a price I'm not hesitant to pay. It's come in handy for my kids too, who also have the same hair-and-brush combination.",4,5
Tasty dishes and pleasant ambience. Minor delays though.,4,4
Beautiful wig This wig is a great quality for the cost but not my favorite. That being said it’s not the wig it’s beautiful the cut just doesn’t look as some of my other wigs.,5,5
Great Hair Piece - easy to use! Received very promptly and the item came well packaged. The color was not quite black but more a dark brown but I used some black root touch up spray i had and it matched great. I highly recommend this item as it took me less than a minute to put the hair piece in place! The claw clip is very easy to use. I wore it this past weekend and many people complimented my bun. I’ve bought a 2nd one to give to a friend!,5,5
"Not quite as useful as it would seem... but sturdy none the less. Fits all my products - just like the photo - but you can't close it with all the brushes in the top because there is no extra room on the top of the other section when it is closed - so whatever is in the top (lid) section needs to be flat or you need to pry the case closed to shut it which isn't quite what I was looking for. If I don't use the lid (for anything other than little eye liner pencils it is fine, but not enough space for everything - plus it weighs a ton. Not sure you really need it to be quite this sturdy. I would recommend using this to transport perfume or something - not make-up.",3,5

DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!! This wig was a disappointment! I washed it straight out the box like I do all off my wigs and once it started drying I noticed alot of short hairs poking out of the frontal. The wig is thin and you can see the tracks at the top. This wig is not worth $200!,1,1
"Made an impressionable impact.. great for teen boys! This was a lifesaver for our son with an acne issue! Being a 17yr. old boy who was feeling the high school inferiority angst at a time in life thats rough enough.. bc duh, it’s High School!! He hoped for a solution to improve his condition and give a boost to his confidence. We ended at a dermatologist who gave us a regiment of:<br />1. wipe the counter clean of all gimmicks/products<br />2. use a dye/scent free soap and water x2 daily<br />3. follow up with clindamycin 1% to dab on larger<br /> trouble spots ONLY..!!<br />So, on our way to where we wanted to go... improvement was ours in leaps and bounds. Then, Covid... Then, the mask mandate!! Soon after we developed a sort of acne/rash on bridge of nose and around mouth 2” due to synthetic material where the mask touches the face. Dr. said mask was compromising the skins ability to breathe and would subside after mandate lifted. Only, attending school x5 days a week 100% fully masked- didn't give skin any reprieve and with no end in sight, I went seeking help for acne irritation.<br /><br />As of now, we’re on the 25th day of Geologie’s 30 day regiment and I am so grateful we found this product. TBH, I personally didn't realize the extent of red, blotchy and puffiness this irritation had brought his poor skin.. until after using approx. 5 days- when we noticed a decrease in the puffy/red that had gradually appeared. Over the last 2wks- it has been clearing things up a little at a time and things seem less inflamed and aggravated. What I’m most impressed with- this hasn’t caused excess breakout like many other products in the past had done and I’m sure it’s bc, of the compound. Nor, has it left skin overly dry.. and both of these are huge!! I’m not even sure how it does it, maybe it’s witchcraft?! For comparison: a BFF uses Proactiv (as seen on TV!) with her 2 son’s for past x3 months and I’m actually surprised the results we had seem similar but, in a lot less time!?<br /><br />The 2 bottles of product are easily identified and instructions are simple easy and straightforward- x1 AM/PM. I applaud the packaging as it doesn’t have a feminine vibe, nothing “fu-fu-“ to turn teen boys away from using “girl stuff!” Trust me, I’ve gone this route before- and it does matter to some! This is a non offensive clean smell and the product itself dissipates/absorbs into the skin easily after application. A few suggestions I have: leave out on bathroom counter to remind one to use daily, use fresh pillowcase every few days to keep any excess bacteria away, wash mask daily if poss. while this mandate applies.. and most of all- keep your hands away! Easier for adults- harder for teens.<br /><br />As with any product there are many factors to it success.. and for obvious reasons. I can’t promise it will cure all issues but, I feel confident in saying you can expect improvement (if not extinct..) end results. I’m so happy to have found this and will be looking into the entire product line for future maintenance use. Sorry so long winded.. I wanted to include details for any in a similar situation- I am hoping this info. may be helpful to someone else in need.. Be safe.",5,5

Good product to aid in look/texturing hair I've used this product for about ten years along with several other products at the same time. My favorite thickening cream is no longer made so I've bumped to using this all the time. It does a decent job of providing lift when combined with drying your hair using a lifting technique. I've tried many products in search of a thickening 'cream' but none currently on the market do as good a job as this. The price on this is also good compared to other products.,5,5

"Very high quality and professional set There are so many uses for tweezers, and I am used to having some from brands like Revlon and such that are okay, but they are not very high quality. The ends are usually dull and they have a hard time grabbing anything. I was extremely happy when I opened this pack of 3. They are a sturdy stainless steel metal, no plastic or cheap aluminum. The ends of the silver one are extremely pointy, perfect for pulling out things like splinters and anything that might get stuck in the skin. My husband was working and ended up with a large splinter under his finger nail. Since you can't exactly get it from the top, we decided to use the silver sharp pair of tweezers and were able to extract the splinter from under his nail. They also work very well for removing hair. I pluck from time to time and the black and pink pair are really nice for that. The silver is easy to get out any ingrown hairs. Overall the set is very high quality and very professional.<br /><br />*I RECEIVED THIS ITEM TO TRY IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW.

I’ve tried every oil free moisturizer and spent a fortune on fancy brands promising to control the oil. Don’t tell me about blotting papers. I’ve used 6 or 7 at a time and they still didn’t work. Kiehl’s has a mild smell, if any at all. I use it exclusively on the T-zone area day and night. Imaging waking up without an oily face for the first time ever.

"What they fail to tell you with any of these ... What they fail to tell you with any of these type products, is that they are water soluble. Aside from leaving a white film if you use too much, you cannot use a foundation over it. The water makes it lose it's efficacy.

Great value! Sinful Colors always works well for me and these grab bags are great for building up my color collection. Beauty Brags always packages well and ships quickly. I have purchased several times from them and will continue to do so.,5,5
Amazing!!! I love washing my hair with this shampoo!!! I have miserable curly dry colored damaged hair and now its soft silky and shiney!!!! So many compliments!!! Amazing product!!! I had highlighyed my hair eight months ago... My color is still rich and gorgeous looking !!! Usually after a month the color fades and my hair looks very damaged and ugly!!! Im a brunette with long hair and slow hair growth. So the natural hair color coming in at the roots blends in well ... Only four inches probably grew anyways!!! Hope they never discontinue this product!! Tired of expensive products that dont work well for my hair type!!!,5,5
Wouldn't recommend at this price.,2,2

"hopeful I like this series of products from Amelie. Each unique cream and at the same time to supplement another. I already have a moisturizing and brightening cream. And then came the moment when the seller me the honor to give a significant discount on this product. I am very happy, because this series is my favorite! This cream is all that is necessary so our skin, especially pleases<br />more than 70% organic ingredients, effectively rejuvenate the skin balanced and not abuse it. I will not say that my skin looks does not matter, I'm already more than two months of use creams from Amelie, but wrinkles - that's my problem. I am a very emotional person, and my spirits give my wrinkles, so this cream - a godsend for me.

"Did not work for me Let me begin this review by stating that I have been using Egyptian, Indian and Pakistani 100% henna for over 30 years with beautiful results that lasted a full 3 months. I decided to try this product because I wanted a change from all the red highlights and thought it would be nice to tone down to a browner hue. I not only followed the instructions to the letter, but had several exchanges with the seller to make sure what I was doing was correct. The good news is that this combination beautifully toned down the red from all my prior years of using henna only. The bad news is that NOT ONE gray hair (I'm dark brown with about 15% gray) gave up being gray! So in addition to the hassle, mess and expense of doing this treatment (and make no mistake - it's messy and time consuming) I will have to double up this month and do my regular henna only routine. I did a bit of research, by the way, and learned that most henna/indigo distributors, unlike Harvest Moon, suggest mixing up the henna and indigo powders SEPARATELY and then combining. Based on my experience, I'd have to say this would probably work better (the rationale probably being the same as why combining shampoo and conditioner together don't work as well as shampooing and THEN conditioning). Likewise, everyone else except Harvest Moon recommends wrapping the hair in plastic wrap and then covering with a shower cap and leaving on for a MINIMUM of 2 hours (Harvest Moon says their product works in less than one hour and is against wrapping.) Leaves me to wonder if the gray hairs would not be gray had I followed the advice of the other henna/indigo distributors. Here's a good reference website: [...]",1,1
Way over priced I like the product. My stylist used it my hair before. It went off the market and one day I just took a chance that maybe it might be back. Well it was back alight. I paid triple the price for it on Amazon!!!!!!,3,5
Thick & Creamy A good hand cream is essential. This one is excellent. It is thick and creamy. It's very moisturizing and is packed with skin-loving botanicals. It's fragrance-free in case you have allergies or just prefer the unscented option. This is a high-quality hand cream that's great to keep in your bag.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review.

Decent Honestly not as great as all the reviews say. Yes it is soothing and yes it clears your skin but it's not like it prevents breakouts or prevents buildup of dead skin. The &#34;bright&#34; look it gives after a wash is typical for any wash and the results are nothing new. I would say the price should be a little lower. Then maybe I would reconsider repurchasing it. At least it doesn't smell like mud. Actually has a pretty nice smell,3,5
Efficient portable cleansing Efficient cleansing and vey soft against the skin. Size is perfect for addressing multiple areas of the body with one Body Wipe. The scent is rather mild which is very desirable.<br />An excellent product and strongly recommended..,5,5
Pretty headbands! Seem to be kinda small. Good quality headbands and very cute! Just wish they were a tad larger or a little stretchier. Fit kinda tight on my adult head.,4,5

"My skin is so soft! I really like this cream! The packaging is super cute, that I don't want to throw the box away. It's a pretty good sized cream. I think this will last me 1-3 months, depending on how often I use it.<br /><br />It sort of smells like lime, but it's not exactly a citrus smell. Even though it shows images of avocado, it doesn't really smell like avocado. It has a gel-like consistency. A little goes a long way, so I recommend only using a little, and adding more as needed. Thankfully, the smell is subtle once you rub it into your skin, and it is not overpowering at all.<br /><br />Normally, my skin is too sensitive to have any scented lotion, so I usually use unscented lotion that contains oatmeal. I put the Mascream on my face, and it stung a teeny tiny bit, but nothing like most scented lotions. I massaged it into my skin, and it feels really soft. You need to let it sink in and dry before you put on any makeup, otherwise it will be too much. I think I prefer this as a night time cream.<br /><br />I got this for free in exchange for my honest review.",5,5
"Can't be beat for the price My hair dryer didn't come with a diffuser and I didn't want to spend a ton of money on something that wouldn't be used often. This diffuser is decent quality for the money spent. It fit well onto my dryer, but didn't have much room to spare. I really had to jam it on, but once in place it didn't budge. I feel that it diffused well enough for what I needed, but I wasn't super impressed with the performance. If I were going to be diffusing on a regular basis, I would spring for a much nicer product. For something that will just be used once in a while, I'm fine with not getting the best results possible.",4,1

"Great Choice! This hair is not bad at all for the price! I waited to write my review after install. First the packaging deserves 2 thumbs up! It was in a nice zip lock type back. 6 bundles with 24 each twists as stated in individual plastic bags. It also came with a note , crochet needle and some hair gems!! KUDDOS!! I was concerned about the color brightness (Too much red) prior to purchase and the seller informed me it wasn’t so bright as the pictures. The seller was half right. The color was bright only under certain light. I am embracing it. The hair is very light in weight. I wish it was 12” as I didn’t want it so long but I’m embracing that as well! The loops were ok when installing, the ends will stick to each other, but not a big bother for me. Overall I’m a VERY satisfied customer, I would purchase again and I HIGHLY recommend!!!",5,5

I like this product I like this product. It has a light smell that is not heavy or offensive. The smell fades after your hair is dry. I have long thick hair and swim a lot. This product works better if I apply to my hair wet and comb it evenly through my hair. Dry application did not work for me. A small amount goes a long way - 3 pumps are enough to coat my hair.,4,5

"Nice cream, gimmicky packaging When I opened this package, I had no idea what I was looking at. Inside the Amazon packaging bag was another bag, a plastic bag with a bubble wrap lining and a ziplock type zipper. Inside that, was what looked like a syringe. Honestly, I was at first convinced I had the wrong order as I had no recollection of ordering anything matching what I was seeing. Upon further investigation, I discovered it was the Play Pretend brand of under eye cream. Yes, the Amazon product page does state the the cream comes in a syringe-like tube, and yes, it does state that it comes with a skincare travel bag, this wasn’t what I had envisioned.<br />On to the product…<br />Once I figured out how to open and operate the syringe (hint: remove the large, clear cap, remove the white tip, turn the plunger to unlock) to dispense the under eye cream, I applied some to my face. The scent is strong, like cucumber with an underlying perfume smell. Not unpleasant, but kind of strong for me, someone who is overly sensitive to scents. My problem, I know, and most people will probably really enjoy the scent. The cream is white, smooth, goes on evenly and is absorbed quickly. There is a bit of a cooling sensation which I found pleasant.<br /><br />The travel bag seems unnecessary to me. It’s really not much more than a heavy ziplock bag lined with bubble wrap with a large logo reading “Skin Set Go.” If someone needs a bag, great, but I have several and I don’t think I’ll be using this one.<br /><br />According to the company’s website, Skin Care Go products are made in the USA in small batches. Good. A lot of natural ingredients go into the product, which I like, but the complete list of ingredients from the company’s website is as follows:<br /><br />Water (Aqua), Carthamus Tinctorius Seed Oil, Polyacrylate-13, Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, Polyisobutene, Squalane, Sodium Hyaluronate, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopherol, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Butylene Glycol, Polysorbate 20, Acetyl Octapeptide-3, Caprylyl Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Fragrance, Yellow 5 (CI 19140), Blue 1 (CI 42090).<br /><br />The final verdict:<br />The product is nice, and while I’d personally prefer something less heavily scented, I like the way the cream works and what it does for my skin. It’s very hydrating and brightening, with nothing that irritated my skin. I understand the idea behind the syringe dispenser: it’s unique, it’s fun, it’s memorable. However, there’s a ton of plastic used that isn’t necessary, and with the design, I don’t know how I’ll know when the tube is nearing empty.<br />Overall, this is a good product, does what it says it does, and if you’re looking for something a little unusual, give it a try.",4,4

"Great gift and sweet romantic color scheme. Well, my lovely 8 month old has a large head. Its very adorable, but large. This has actually been confirmed by our doctor who then measured our heads and said it was genetic. :) That being said, we have a hard time finding bows that actually fit her. These are just now starting to get a bit tight and causing some indent marks. The colors are really wonderful and go with just about everything. We get a lot of complements on her bows. With her light hair, I will say that the black one tends to look like a pirate patch but other than that they are great. Not to mention the price was phenomenal. I seem to not find single bows for under six bucks when at retail stores.<br /><br />Oh, in case anyone is wondering, they come with little felt backs, and they were packaged in a clear envelope of sorts with a little sticker from the seller. This would make a wonderful gift for baby showers.",5,5

"A little ruff I bought these because I got tired of the meshy plasticky round ball ones that unravel after a brief time. I love mine but my wife didn't like hers and went back to the other style. They are a little ruff on the skin but I feel very clean after my shower. Great at exfoliating if you ask me but again my wife thought they were a little too ruff. I guess it's a personal taste thing, you may or may not like these but for the price of these it won't be a big deal if they don't work out for you. Also my wife managed to rip hers almost in half, she said she dosnt know how it ripped but she always says &#34;I don't know&#34; when she breaks something, LOL. Mine is holding up very well so far. Update mine started ripping and pieces started shedding shortly after my wifes. To bad they dont hold up well. Had to deduct a couple of stars.",2,5

Painless shave This hair removal works amazing. It actually removes the hair and you dont feel the pull like you do with most small hair . this can fit in your pocket or purse. Its quick and painless. Very easy to clean. Just unscreaw the top and it comes out in a hair roll. Once clean close and store or use. It holds a good amount of hair per shave so you get a lot done. I tested it on my leg 1st before trying anywhere else and it truly works amazing,5,5

"Perfect Size To get the one negative out of the way, these are not as durable as other brands. They pretty much disintegrate after one use. However, unlike others these aren’t gigantic and they are the perfect size for my face. They are also very soft and the texture side is not scratchy at all. Using disposable face towels have been a game changer for my skincare and has helped immensely in preventing breakouts.",4,5
Don't Buy a Waste of Money! They were cute but they came with broken squished clips and they had a terrible smell when I took them out of the package. It reminded me of cow manure. A waste of money.

Best hair on a budget I bought this hair and brought it to my stylist to save money and she was so impressed with the quality that she bought some for herself to use for her clients. My own hair is terribly thin so I decided not to reinstall after 6 weeks of compliments and loving having this glorious shiny hair. I decided to be crafty and order a cheap synthetic clip in set for about $10 on ebay and cut the synthetic hair off save an inch or so and then recycled my beautiful tape ins by installing them to the clip in set. Works perfectly and I can take it off and on without the damage having the tape ins caused.,5,5

"For Facial Use Only! First off, you shouldn't be shaving anything but your face with this razor. Norelco's older models seem to be heavier and have more powerful motors; this thing is more like those old electric lawnmowers that couldn't cut grass more than 1/2"" high. It gives a middling shave on face and neck, but it certainly can't handle the forest around the Great Oak Tree, if you know what I mean. It also won't do armpits or backs or legs very well.<br /><br />I'd go with an older model that is heavier and seems to have a more powerful motor.

Invigorating This grapefruit scrub smells just like grapefruit. I take my showers in the morning and find this scent to invigorate me. I was concerned at first because the color of the scrub is bright orange and I didn't know if it would tint my skin...it didn't. This scrub is medium sized in exfoliating crystal. It is a drier consistency and is easy to apply. I just dumped some in my hand and gently massaged it into my skin. It leaves your skin hydrated and soft.

"Too Stiff The clips break easily when stepped on while wearing shoes. Seriously, my problem is that the hinges on all of them are so stiff that I can't open them when I want to, which is while holding my hair in a bun with my left hand and trying to squeeze the clip open with my right. I can only open one, with difficulty, while it's on a flat surface and squeeze so hard it hurts my fingers. Unfortunately, I wanted clear octopus clips and these were the only ones I could find anywhere. I didn't really need four. Well, not even three, which is what I have now since I stepped on one. However, if you have stronger hands than I do, these ARE equivalent to Scunci octopus clips, which I can't find in clear.",3,5

Wouldn’t really buy again [[VIDEOID:dfbf142714baccec8f58f8b26367ba48]] So to start I did not get the type of wig I thought I was buying it was not like the description or pictures at all I was going to return it but I had already made an hair appointment and couldn’t do anything else last minute they had the option for t shape wigs which I did not pick but got that kind of wig anyway so your pictures and review are misleading it would be nice if what we were buying had the correct photo and description,2,1

Straightener is amazing Great sleek looking straightener...I like that the plates float makes it look expensive. It Heats up great and I can straighten my waist length 2a/b hair in 10 min and my sister who has long 3a hair in 30 min. Hope that helps,5,5

"Pretty good! I am a low maintenance person so I was looking for something to help take out the frizz from my hair. Although it says it's a ""Straightening Brush"", I decided to take a risk on this item.<br /><br />After my 1st use, my hair didn't look super smooth nor super straight like the picture shown but it did help take out the frizz a bit! I don't think it's perfect but it's worth keeping it!",4,5

"Looks Great! I am very happy with my Marrywindix acrylic organizer! I have limited counter space for my cosmetics and beauty products. Prior to ordering this organizer, I had all of my lipsticks & lip glosses shoved in a small drawer. Because they were over crowded, I had difficulties finding the ones that I wanted when I wanted them. Now I can easily see most of my lip products at a quick glance. The organizer is only 6 inches wide and 4 inches deep, so it doesn't take up a whole lot of counter space. The acrylic is sturdy & solid and is easy to clean. Recently I have been looking at acrylic organizers recently in my local stores and they seem to be over priced! This one is bargain!! My teenage daughter tried to claim this one from me, but since it is such a reasonable price, I will probably just go ahead & order her one, too.<br /><br />****Update - I ended up ordering another style of the Marrywindix acrylic organizer for my daughter. This one has drawers in addition to storage on top for brushes & bottles. She LOVES it! It is very well made and looks great! Each drawer comes with a liner to keep things nice and neat.<br /><br />*I received my acrylic organizer from Marrywindix for the purpose of trying out & reviewing. My thoughts & opinions are my own.",5,5

"My hair LOVES this product. Provides a well-defined, extremely moisturized and bouncy twist out. This is an extremely moisturizing cream that my 4a/4b hair absolutely drinks up!! My hair is extremely dry after washing and letting it air dry (even though I always add a leave-in and oil). So, I decided to use this to help moisturize and twist my hair. I could just feel my hair going from super dry to extremely soft and moisturized from just one application of each section! I also applied this over castor oil, which I applied to my hair beforehand. (I use the L.O.C. moisturization method).<br /><br />I then twisted my hair and applied this generously (my twist outs always come out better when I'm more generous with my product of choice). After 10 hours or so, I took out my twists and had a very well-defined twist out! There was absolutely no frizz - even after separating each twist (I undo the twist and the split each section in half). I'm really happy with the results.<br /><br />The pics I'm included are of a two-day-old twist out (I forgot to take a pic on the first day) and my hair still looks great - a little frizzy from sleeping on it, but nothing horrible. I just spritzed on a little leave-in conditioner to refresh my hair and it looked just as good as the first day. This cream is wonderful and allows me to easily go 4-5 days on one twist out - something that many other products just don't do for my hair.<br /><br />This has a really sweet, pleasant smell to it. It's a white cream that's on the thick side, but very easy to work with and absorbs nicely into the hair - doesn't just sit on top. I also love that it doesn't make my hair feel all crunchy or crispy. My twist out was really soft and my curls were bouncy. Thanks to providing great hold, amazing definition, and complete hydration for dry, frizzy hair, you can't get wrong using this product!<br /><br />I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review. All opinions are 100% mine.",5,5

"Good quality and price for anyone learning to braid hair. I ordered this styling head so that my daughters, who are ages 6 and 15, and I can learn various hair braiding styles and techniques. This is a good styling head for us to practice on. It is easy to attach to tables and countertops. It stays securely in place without moving or falling off. I ordered this in the fun and vibrant Rainbow color because it looks cool and fits in with the decor in my daughters’ room. This styling head came with a small pack of hair ties and a hair clip. The synthetic hair tangles easily and comes out whenever we brush it. We like the thickness and length of the hair. For amateurs like us, this is a decent styling head to practice new hair styling techniques. I am glad that I got this instead of the styling head doll that my daughter originally wanted. The size, quality, and price of this are much better than the toy versions.",4,3

"I really like these wipes I really like these wipes. I think they are pretty handy in case you get dirty or wind up finding some weird stain on your arm or something. Who knows? Though i found these most useful when trying to get hair dye off of my neck. I have to dye my hair every 3 to 4 weeks because its fades so fast and i wind up with hair dye on my skin for a good week afterwards because it won't come off! I have tried nail polisher remover, soap and water, even makeup remover and they don't work that well. Now once these came in the mail, i tried them out and what do you know, they actually helped a lot. The wipe i used was full on pink when i got done! I am so happy and i think these are gonna come in handy a lot more.",4,5

"Light Cream, Good for Day Use This light cream has a lovely, not-too-heavy scent, and smooths onto my skin quite easily. There is no draggy feeling as with heavier creams. And that is both a plus and a negative. While I like this for daytime because it doesn't feel greasy, it does not feel hydrating enough for night time, at least not for my old skin. I like that this product is made in the USA, and that it is cruelty free, although ""cruelty free"" claims need to be taken with a grain of salt.<br /><br />The pump bottle works well, and keeps air out of the product, but there is no over-cap or anything, so this is best left on the counter. Putting it in a travel bag could cause a mess.<br /><br />Although I like this for a day cream, I can't find that it contains any sun protection, so if you are going to spend any time in the sun, you'll need a separate product.<br /><br />This seems a good product, but in my opinion, it is not outstanding, doesn't really differentiate itself from dozens of other products in all price ranges.",3,5
"Worth the Splurge (for oily-normal skin) Thhis cream is divine! I love the amber and vanilla combination of scents and it lingers for half the day. It is quite pricey so I use it sparingly. It is also not the best cream for the winter when my skin is prone to dryness and ashy. So if you have normal skin, like the rich smell of amber, and don't mind spending a little extra on cosmetics this is a sweet product!",5,5

"Nice moisturizing sheet mask that smells nice This is an pretty nice face sheet mask in my opinion. In the pack you get 4 masks for about $15, so almost $4 per mask, not the cheapest but also not the most expensive I have used to date.<br /><br />The masks are very easy to use. They come individually wrapped and are folded nicely. The material of these is not the softest I have used but they work. They smell REALLY nice however, a nice gentle floral with some other tones mixed in, very nice. You use these for about 15 to 20 minutes or so and gently rub the remainder of the mask into your skin.<br /><br />When I was done my skin felt pretty soft over. This mask is nice but it is not my favorite. My skin also had a nice residual scent left from the mask which I did enjoy. I would have expected a little better for the price since I have used cheaper masks that were nicer. All in all these are pretty nice though.",4,5
"Love it I was skeptical after reading the reviews and taking note of the cheap price, but I gave it a shot and I'm glad I did. I never, ever use any type of lotion on my face because my skin is already like an oil slick. However, after using this product for just over a week, I ordered two more bottles.<br /><br />This lotion seems to be controlling the oil on my face. There's a lot less of it now. I have acne scars and red blotches from 40 years of bad skin, but now my skin tone has evened out. I was also recently diagnosed with sebaceous hyperplasia and my dermatologist said there is nothing to be done except have the spots removed if they bother me. The smaller spots have now vanished and the big one has stopped growing. This is why I ordered two additional bottles.<br /><br />Also, other reviews complain about the eye dropper. I've had no trouble using it. The lotion is thin enough that it is easily sucked into the dropper. The only issue is that the outside of the dropper has lotion on it so it sometimes gets on the neck of the bottle when I put it back. I'd definitely recommend this product.",5,5

"Quick, easy, blendable & at drugstore prices....gotta love it!! I think we all have days where we're looking for something quick and easy when it comes to makeup. Anything to get us out the door looking somewhat put together with the least amount of time involved is the goal. If you're looking for a quick eyeshadow look that takes next to no time these are one answer. Cream eyeshadow on one end and a brush on the other. The brush is surprisingly usable, but since I've got older eyes (which means older skin that needs to be babied) I just use one of mine. They go on pretty smooth and creamy. Not a ton of pigment on the first pass, but it's very buildable. The swatches on my arm are 2 passes of each color. They also blend out really well. I put a couple passes on my lower lid and blend it up into my crease and I'm good to go. There is a bit of shimmer in this one, but it's not overwhelming. Just a bit of sparkle that looks good even on aging eyes. They make it through the whole day, but I did notice some creasing and breakdown after about 6-8 hours. Not a lot, just enough to be noticeable. Overall these were pretty impressive and I think they'd also be great for someone who was just getting into makeup too.",5,5

"Not for thinner hair I loved the idea of this product, but it is not easy to do yourself. With that said, I think some more practice will yield faster results. However, I had to use a large amount of gel/intense hairspray to hold my hair in the clip. I have typical fine, blonde hair and it wouldn't even hold in the little clips sections without gel (think prepping for a gymnastics competition where not a single hair will budge). To have the large clip stay in position, I put that section of hair in a ponytail holder first. The results looked awesome, but it was awful to get the hair products out afterward. Definitely made for thicker hair",4,5

"Excellent Mineral Makeup Choice Excellent. I've used other mineral lines, all more expensive. This one is equal to, or better than, the more expensive lines, with a couple caveats:<br />1. The brush set is a fairly cheap one. This is fine with me, though- I wanted the makeup, not the brushes. The cost savings gave me plenty to buy a brush after.<br />2. I wish the makeup had tops that could close for travel. Like all loose powders, they can make quite a mess being shaken around, then opened.<br />3. (edit) forgot to mention, my bag is pink, not black- again, not a big deal, but nice to know!<br />Other than that, I am very happy with this set-<br />the bisque cover alone was worth the price- works better to cover blemishes than any I've ever used. I adore it, and it's my new makeup from now on.<br />I also meant to mention- this set is fair without being pinky- which is amazing! I always have a problem because I am pale- but not pink!",4,5

Teleties - Spring Collection Hair Ties I don't know why these types of hair ties are popular.

"Wasn't sure but was surprisingly effective I wasn't really sure about this and when I first opened it I became even more skeptical. It looked like a paper towel and I had to wet it? Fortunately I thought ahead and opened it before soaking it in water and it was relatively easy to handle. I didn't love wearing it for 30 minutes, I got annoyed by then with the masque but 20 minutes was about my limit and I did see results. I liked the masque overall and it seemed to improve the tone and texture of my skin. I knocked off a point because it was a bit cumbersome to use and waiting around for 30 minutes seemed too much for me. I've got very sensitive skin and this was not of problem for me to use (although I did patch test first). If you know what you are going into (the time and effort) I'd recommend this product. If you don't have the time or want to bother with soaking the masque first, try something else but this does work!",4,1

"Comprehensive review of robusta coffee scrub I recently used this scrub and felt inspired to write a review about it for those that aren't sure if they should get this scrub or not.<br /><br />Before buying this scrub, I was aware coffee scrubs have been trending for a year or so. As others, I was very skeptical about it and wasn't sure how I felt about this beauty trend. The only way I was going to find out was to give it a try.<br /><br />Here's what I learned after using it that I think will help others should you decide to try it:<br /><br />1) Prepare your environment and set aside time before using it - Prior to using the scrub, decide where you are going to use it (shower, bath, fenced backyard, etc.) because I'm warning you now, it's gonna get messy. I have a regular sized shower/bath, so if I plan on using this again, I would get myself completely wet, sit in the tub, use the scrub all over my body, rinse off (still sitting), then finally stand up to complete washing off. If you have a private fenced off backyard where you are near a hose, that's a good setting too. The whole process took approximately 40-50 minutes (I like to take my time). I used the whole pack because I literally used it all over my body, but you can use whatever amount you want. Just know that you will need time to really work it into your skin and let it set for a few minutes before washing it off.<br /><br />2) Be honest with yourself about your skin regimen - What I mean is, if you are not disciplined about your skin regimen or don't want to take time to use this scrub, then honestly I don't know this product is going to work for you. Personally, I'm committed to a regular and consistent skin regimen and set aside time to use this product to get optimal results. I am just saying this isn't like a typical scrub and takes more time to work it in to your skin.<br /><br />3) You'll likely need soap to get the rest of it off - Even after a rinse, it will stain, just like coffee will do, so I used some shea butter body wash and a body brush to get the rest of it off. Once I was completely clean, I dried off and used body shop cocoa butter all over my body (it's what I usually use anyway).<br /><br />4) For people with very oily skin be aware - Since this product has coconut oil and you are highly prone to breaking out, I'm not sure if this is a good idea; the amount of coconut oil is definitely noticeable so just be aware.<br /><br />The verdict: I will say, this made me feel amazing afterwards. My skin felt very smooth and soft. That being said, I bought it without having any expectations. I tried it mainly out of curiosity. As there are advances in beauty products, I am naturally going to want to try new things. I have heard that coffee scrubs reduce cellulite or supports regeneration of new skin cells. Honestly I don't know if that's true and frankly find that doubtful. However, I can say it is better than most scrubs I've used in the past, and it's a wonderful treat for the skin from time to time. I would buy and use it again for occasional use.",4,5
Service was unhelpful and waited too long.,2,2

"Health and product review Let me start off with saying I do not use makeup daily, more like once a week if that but I still recommend the same advice even for daily makeup wearers: change this out either once every week or every two weeks. This is not because the quality is poor, this is for health reasons. All sponges collect bacteria.<br /><br />Now on to the product review, this showed up really fast with prime and comes with two cases, one to carry a single one and the second to store the rest. Having them as two different colors helps a lot and makes it fun to change. They are soft but not too porous, the makeup will sink in a bit but not too much. These are better suited for applying makeup but not blending them together. I recommend lightly (or roughly if you don’t care) patting your face rather than dragging or rubbing it on, you’ll just end up taking the makeup off your skin.",5,5

"May work for you depending on eye shape Magnetic eyelashes are an interesting concept for those times you want a dramatic look but don't want the hassle of glue on lashes. The magnetic liner works well but it must be applied pretty thick in order to give enough area for the lashes to stick. You have to be careful when placing them also as you cannot really adjust the position because pulling the lashes off usually tears the liner off with it, so you have to then clean the lashes and reapply liner if you make a mistake which is kind of a hassle. The two lashes included here are nice but neither one really worked for my eye shape, I got another kit which had 7 different shapes in it and that one had two styles that work well for me so I would probably recommend getting one with more options to ensure you find one that fits your eye shape.",4,5

They do pick up the product well and they blend well. I unfortunately can't get the looks I want with them because of their size.<br /><br />Also, they are scratchy. I read that you have to hold your brushes slightly different when using natural bristles and not press as hard. I don't know if that is true or not. I have limits to how much I want it to hurt to look pretty, lol<br /><br />I have to use hair conditioner after I wash the natural bristle brushes so that they don't fray as much.<br /><br />I'm keeping them because they look great on my vanity/cosmetic area but I ordered a higher end set of eye brushes that work better for me (JS).",2,5

"Supposed to promote a more youthful appearance This Rose Quartz Roller with Derma Roller 0.25mm is a great value for this facial kit. It’s giftable and is believed that the microneedling treatment and pink jade roller is supposed to stimulate collagen. I’ve only used both for a few days so I can’t say effective this product will be, but I’m willing to give it a try. The jade roller is great to use when applying your favorite face serum. It glides and rolls smoothly. The microneedling treatment is not too painful when you simply apply a little bit of pressure. It did not cause bleeding because I used it gently as directed. You do need to be sure to only use it on clean skin and wash it after each use. I am hoping to see more vibrant skin after using these tools for a few weeks.",4,5
"I absolute adore these! I bought the travel containers to fill with lotions and sanitizer to keep in my purse and car.

"Not sure of the 5-Star rave Reviews here on Amazon for this Goat Milk Soap? It was not for me I just purchased an 8-Bar Pack of this Australian Botanical Goats Milk Soya Bean Oil Soap for $18.00 here on Amazon from A Seller Called, Asset Liquidation Sales. I expected allot better quality, moisturizing & clean rinsing Soap for my Face & Body with this Goat Milk Soap that is Made in Australia... The turnout from me with the first use of this Soap for just Three Days was not appealing nor was it moisturizing to me in any way! When I washed my Face with it in the Mornings & Evenings, it lathered up quite well. However when I rinsed it off, I could feel & right away noticed that it was not a clean rinsing Soap. It left a kind of sticky, oily residue feeling on my Face & Hands while rinsing it off. Then about 30 to 45 Minutes after washing with this Soap, I really noticed the unwelcome & unwanted Soap Scum residue left over from this Soap on my Face & my Skin was no longer even one bit moisturized but instead, dry, Soap Scummy Residue feeling & was becoming very itchy because of this non clean rinsing Goat Milk Soap. My hands were really & truly showing the left over Soap Scum Residue from this Soap as for they were turning very White scaly, dry Color about an Hour after use & cracking which they were not near this bad before using this Soap.<br /><br />Therefore, in my opinion, this Soap is of not great quality, cleans Skin very poorly & does not rinse clean off of the Skin at all. Thus leaving behind a hidden but noticeably delayed Soap Scum Residue which from me does not earn this Soap no crazy rave 5-Stars like many others here have reviewed & given this Soap. I won't buy this Soap again or even this brand of Soap & am simply donating the remaining unused 7-Bars to my local Salvation Army Thrift Store just to get rid of it out of my House & Hands.",1,5

"Not amazing, but a nice product. .<br />I had never used a &#34;bamboo serum&#34; when I ordered this and was curious about it.<br /><br />Predictably, I can't tell that it 'helped supercharge collagen production,' or 'lift sagging skin,' or 'reduce the appearance of age spots' (no serum will do that), but I do like the way it helps firm my skin before I apply makeup. It has a sticky feel coming out of the bottle (mine came with a dropper rather than a pump), and it feels a bit odd going on -- sort of like rubbing mayonnaise into your skin. But then it absorbs well and leaves my skin a bit tighter and smoother. One reviewer has perfectly described the effect as akin to putting on pantyhose -- everything just feels held together nicely.<br /><br />I can't honestly say I will re-order this, because I use a pore refiner that does a better job of leaving my face makeup-ready, and Vitamin C serum seems to leave my skin clearer and nicer. But this works well enough that I finished the bottle.<br /><br />For those who want to use bamboo serum, this one is probably worth a try. Take a look at the wide variance in product pricing.",4,5

"some were quite good, but none of really makes my hair look ... I've had many hair straighteners and smoothing/curling brushes in the past; some were quite good, but none of really makes my hair look as good as this one. I don't even have to use my hair dryer anymore (my hair is fine, and dries quickly). It was a fine curling brush/hair dryer (https://www.amazon.com/Revlon-Shine-Enchancing-Hot-Air/dp/B00022WA9K/ref=sr_1_2_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1470675698&sr=8-2&keywords=revlon+hair+dryer+brush), and I liked it a lot; but this is far better, and I get lots od compliments lately on my hair.<br /><br />If I just use the curling brush, my hair looks good for a day...great for when I'm kind of in a rush. But when I take the time to use the straightener, my hair looks great until next time I wash it. My favorite look is when I straighten it, then clamp the plates together to make the curling brush.<br /><br />I still haven't figured out the &#34;3 in 1&#34;, I only know of 2...but it is a great duo.",5,5

"Use All Palette Colors For A Change, Look Great w/ My Light Skin, Simple Instructions, Good Quality This RealHer Ultimate Glow Getter Cheek Trio is a hit. I’m not one for a complicated makeup routine and also don’t like experimenting a lot with my makeup, so love that this compact includes my contour bronzer, blush and highlighter and step-by-step application instructions for applying and blending all three colors. It’s rare that I can use all colors in a palette, so I’m really pleased that all three colors work beautifully together and actually flatter my skin tone. The highlighter and even the blush can be used as eye makeup too.<br /><br />I have light skin with an olive hue. I knew the bronzer and highlighter colors would work as I wear similar shades from my regular bronzer palette, but I wasn’t sure about wearing a peachy blush color as I’ve always worn red and pink shades. But I’m so glad I tried this palettes I realize I should have shifted to wearing a peachy shade ages ago as it goes with my skin tone well. This peach doesn’t have too much orange and is rather neutral, but it gives my skin a natural flush that’s pretty. These colors are buildable, so I start light (especially with the bronzer).<br /><br />These are well pigmented and apply evenly with no streaking. I have dry skin but get a smooth, velvety application. The colors are long lasting as I wore them all day yesterday, and my makeup still looked good at the end of the day. These powders don’t settle in my fine lines, and it’s quick and easy to apply and blend the colors with just one brush. The palette is made in China, but the box says this is certified cruelty free. I’m really happy with this palette, and the quality exceeds my expectations at the current $28 price. Love it. 5 stars.",5,5
"Spend the extra dollars to get some quality nails I always have to shape and file these nails because the part at the cuticle is square while my cuticles (and everybody else’s?) are rounded. It adds a significant time to my nail prep and it’s completely unnecessary.

At first it seemed it was going to stay tight, but when I lightly pressed the fingers into the back of my head with high heat, the snozzle came off. At one point it even came off of the diffuser.

I have tried ones from a local dollar store that weren’t very sturdy; they kept breaking off during the day.<br />I decided to give these a try. I am impressed by the quality. The elastics are sturdy. The elastic stayed put in his hair for 24 hours through work and sleep.<br />This product comes with a lot of hair bands!

"Great quality but color is off First of all the hair is silky, soft and quite a lot volume. I have medium amount and hair. Most 70g-100g hair is not enough for me. This is perfect. I don’t need more than a pack and I have shoulder length hair. The ends are thinner but not as thin as others. Yes you can buy the $200-300 name brand where the ends are just as thick as the top but it doesn’t look natural and the price$$$. The band is definely more comfortable specially for the pieces on the top of the head. Unfortunately the color didn’t work for me. I ordered the ombré since I already have dark brown with ash blonde ombré myself. The transition colors to the blonde ends are gorgeous! Match me to the T. However, it is the root color not matching nor as described. It should be #2 dark brown, but compare to my own it is definely black #1 if not even jet black. It’s too obviously on my head so I cant get away from wearing it. However, the hair quality is so good I definitely will purchase this brand in another color. Good luck!",3,5

"Great product and price! I have been using this consistently for over a month. I use it twice a day by gently patting it into my skin after I use my toner. A little bit goes a long way, so this is a good value for your money. Also, the texture is a bit sticky when you rub it in but it dries quickly. I also like that it is unscented and rich.<br />In the last month this along with moisturizer has helped to clear the dry spots that were around my nose and eye area.<br />This will definitely be a repurchase because my skin has looked healthy and brighter since I have been using this serum.",5,5
"Relieves tension and stress These ice globes have a nice pop of color. Each globe is colorful, smooth and well made. I find these to be helpful to use both alone and in home spa care. After I have done a mask or an exfoliating treatment, I find these globes to be soothing. You can control how cold you get them by how long you leave them in the fridge or let them sit out a bit before using. I think they relieve tension and stress significantly. They are easy to use and straightforward too. Keeping them clean is easy to do as soap and water is all you need. I really like the way they feel on my skin and how they truly help me to relax.",4,5

The first few times that I used this oil, I felt very relaxed & sleepy, but that has worn off with continued use.<br />I find it is a great value for the size of the bottle, as a little goes a long way.

"Good little trimmer with a couple drawbacks First of all, to get the vac to work correctly you have to trim very slowly. The vac is powerful, but it's not THAT powerful. If you trim like a speed demon, you'll have hair clippings all over your counter.<br /><br />Aside from that, this is a great little trimmer. It's not that loud, the blades cut very well, the locking comb settings stay in place, and the charge lasts forever. I trimmed for 3 weeks on a single charge, and I trim about once every 3 days. It would have been nice if there was a carrying case included, but it's not a deal breaker.<br /><br />At Amazon's current price, this is a great deal for a good trimmer.",4,5

"Works to dry drippy hair faster after a shower The package contained 3 microfiber Towel Wrap Turbans: one pink, one lavender, and one striped (orange, pink, blue, white). They are 26"" in length. After a shower, I've wanted to wrap my long hair up in a towel for a while because otherwise it drips down my back as it dries. But I've never mastered getting a towel to stay in place. This product does help: place the large ""hood"" section in place on your head, tuck your hair into the tail then twist the tail one or two times, and secure the elastic loop over the button. It stays in place okay as long as you don't try to pull a shirt on over it (or similar activity). I put it on for about 20 minutes after my shower, and the Wrap is pretty wet when I take it off. My hair's still damp, but it dries much faster after that and doesn't drip down my back. So it works.",4,5

"Recommended I've been very happy with this brush. My hair has always been thin, but since it has started getting more gray, it has become more dry & coarse. I've been using a flat iron to smooth it out and get rid of the kinky nature. This has worked great for me instead. I wash it, dry it, and then just brush. One word of caution, the nubs are very hot, so you can put your hand over them, also, your hair will be warm for a few seconds after you brush thru it. I discovered I could use a dry wash cloth or heat resistant glove to assist in keeping my hair against the warming surface. As I place the brush under my hair & brush downward, I place my other hand (protected by cloth or glove) over the nubs, thereby holding the hair tight against the surface. The smoothing effect is great without any burning of the hair like with a straight iron. We also used it on my mixed race granddaughter whose hair is much thicker and kinkier. It took a little longer than it did on me, but it did smooth her hair faster than with a hot iron.",5,5
Excellent trainers and clean equipment.,5,5
It works This is a nice product although I am still getting used to it. It is quite heavy and a little awkward to use as the the barrel is long. It does work though! I have fine hair so it doesn’t take it long to get it straight. This might be better for someone who has more experience with hair. Maybe even longer hair. I have arthritis so it might be why I am struggling with it. I will probably stick with a lighter weight straightener and keep this as a back up. A bit disappointed. I wish the barrel wasn’t so long and heavy. Seems like it’s built to last though and that’s a plus.,3,3

"Mine had defects First, the good: hair is soft, silky and only a tiny bit too shiny. It has good style and only shed a small amount on removing from package and brushing. Not too much hair, but not thin or flimsy. Has two combs at the top in front to secure wig, and the adjustable latches at the neck. I was prepared to love it forever and buy ten more. However:<br />The not so good and the bad: the color is flat black, there is no natural color variation and looks like a poor dye job, the ear tabs did not align with my actual ears, and so poked out to the sides a bit. The hair line would not lay flat to my head, and when I tried to pull some of the front strands to the side to keep them out of my eyes, I saw that the seams are thick and obvious. Since it has a bit of lace at the top I figured to reset the part, but there is a seam in the middle of the lace, so parting it<br />in any other location within the lace area literally shows a fat black seam.<br /><br />Now, I am not a wig expert. I don't know how to make a mediocre wig great, and to this wig's credit, it is better than mediocre. So if you happen to be one of those people with such knowledge, this is a fabulous wig to mess with and work your magic on. And perhaps my particular wig is a defect that slipped through, but regardless, it is a disappointment to me. I would return it, but I made the mistake of cutting the lace right away (like I said, I was excited about how great the wig looked lol). Perhaps down the road I will find a magic maker who can make my wig work for me, so it's not a total loss. Just disappointing.",2,5

"Adding this to my regular routine This is a really nice oil with subtle improvements to my skin. I feel more confident about my face being clear when I wake up. Winter is usually terrible for my skin, because of dryness and getting red. This helped reduce redness and helps even out the tone.",5,5

Depends on the buyer If you like lashes that are more synthetic as opposed to the ones made of hair you may like these. I find synthetic lashes to have a thicker band and doesn’t adhere very well especially to the inner eyelids. They look good buy I wish it were made of different material.,4,1

Not for Thick Hair I get more compliments on this hair stick. I bought because I have super thick hair & it's hard to get clips & other hair accessories to work in my hair.

"A Great Combination I love the combination of this shampoo and conditioner. Both smell like sweet coconut.<br />The shampoo has a thick and luxurious lather and definitely feels like it adds volume to my hair.<br />The conditioner is thick, but light, a bit like a body butter. It softens my hair and leaves it extremely soft and silky.<br />The only reason I can't give these products five stars is because I think they're a bit overpriced. Yes, they create great results, but so do a lot of comparable brands that are less than half the price.",4,5

On/off button drives me crazy! Can't use it with out hitting the on/off button no matter how I position my hand. It hurts and doesn't straighten my hair very well. I do however have very thick curly hair. The button placement is the worst. I could possibly deal with the rest.,1,1
Poor cleanliness and unhelpful staff.,2,2
"As useful as all the reviews indicate I bought this product because my heels become very rough in the winter. The dry skin was catching on my socks and sheets and annoying me. I had tried a manual file, but that was totally ineffective. This product is easy to charge and use. It holds it's charge for at least 40 minutes. I used the foot file on dry feet every day for 4 days and now am using it once a week as a maintenance routine. It is gently run back and forth over the skin to grind away the dead skin. There is no discomfort. There is quite a bit of foot dandruff created. Follow with some moisturizer and put your socks on! Voila!",5,5

"So much better than 5 magnet eyelashes After trying several of the 5 magnet type, I found these and I'm so glad I did! The 5 magnet type never worked after I tried to cut them to the right size because there was never a magnet on the end, which made it impossible to get them to stay on without using glue. I found these with 10 smaller magnets and thought I would give them a try! I was able to cut them to the right size and still have magnets on both ends, so they would stay on. I am not very good at applying liquid liner, but I was able to get this liner to work just fine. I used these for my wedding and they stayed on all day/evening and weren't too heavy feeling like some lashes. They really made my eyes pop and stand out beautifully in pictures! In the photos, the close ups were before the wedding to try them out, and although the one end wouldn't stay on that time, I was able to get it to stay on the wedding day.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like (which is the same with all of these magnetic liners) is that the liner is difficult to remove. The lashes themselves came off fine, but the liner was not easy to remove (from my skin or the lashes). I don't like to use makeup removers, so I used coconut oil. It took some time to get it off. But I don't think that's anything specific to this liner, it's the magnetic liners in general.<br /><br />I recommend these lashes over all of those 5 magnet ones!",4,3

"so I am satisfied with this cream This cream has actually made a slight difference so far. I have been using this for almost two weeks and I'm starting to notice my breasts do feel fuller. They are still the same size but the shape has improved. I am a former bf mom so they are not as perky as they once were. I wouldn't say this is a replacement for surgery or anything though. For me just seeing any improvement is exciting, so I am satisfied with this cream. I wasn't really expecting this to work in the beginning, I began to see a difference around the third day. I used it twice a day.<br /><br />The smell is a little different. It was musky to me. It doesn't smell bad.. but it could be better. The size is probably enough for a few months, I still have tons so a little goes a long way. The consistency is thick and really blendable. A little nickel sized amount is about what I use each time because it spreads easily. It really just feels like lotion on your skin, it isn't sticky or gel like.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like about this was the fragrance, the scent is not a scent I would normally wear but since it does seem to benefit my breasts it<br />Is a scent I can live with, I just spray perfume over my shirt and it covers it up.<br /><br />Overall I am happy about this cream, even with the change being suttle so far it still has some affect and that's better than nothing for me. I'm hoping I see more improvement with this in the long run and I will continue using it.<br /><br />I did receive this product at a discount or for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I do express my reviews honestly by the actual experience I have with the product.",5,3

"Press and HOLD for on/off, and tap button to change modes. At first I thought it didn't work, but it works like my bike flasher, not like other flossers. Press 'on' button for 2 seconds to turn on/off and tap the button to cycle through the modes. It remembers the mode it was in when turned off too, like my bike flasher. Doesn't hold a lot of water but very easy to refill. Can't comment on battery life since I just got it. Perfect for travel since the nozzle fits inside and it collapses to 6 inches. Takes very little space on bathroom sink. My gums have started to receed and dentist suggested the oral irrigator to clean out food debris. Like this model a lot and I've used several. Just remember to hold the button down 2 seconds to turn on.",5,5

"excellent; less expensive and higher quality than others If you haven't used one of these before, they're great for curly hair - holding things in place without potential breakage. I've been buying them often since my previously-straight hair turned curly a year or two back, and they're super helpful. I love this bulk package since this type of hair tie does tend to break occasionally (especially if you pull them all the way tight, since that's not the intended usage), but these seem stronger than most, and they cost significantly less than the other ones I've been buying",4,5
"Great Curls! I’m so glad I finally bought one of these automatic curlers! I love that it’s wireless. It charges with a usb charger and the battery lasts quite a while. I watched a few videos to get the hang of doing it. It took a few tries, but my curls came out great. It beeps when it’s time to release the curl which is awesome. If you’re ready to try a new way of curling your hair, I highly recommend buying this!",5,5

"A good moisturizer, but not for me. Initially the first week I had used this it felt amazing and I thought my acne would finally disappear once and for all, that thought was kept in my head for four weeks after and when I had completely used up the product I knew that this is just another product that does not work for my facial acne. However as it is said it could also be used on other places to moisturize and on my arms and hair I did notice change and worked great on those places. When I did use it on my face I did notice change, I had less whiteheads and blackheads but only decreased them.",3,1

"I love it, and all the stencils I know you want photos, but trust me, if you take the time to find the right stencil, and they are all different and subtle, you can find a really great shape and size for your perfect look.<br /><br /> I am terrible at drawing eyebrows, and the stencils make it easy. You do have to use soap and water to remove the powder well. The spoolie and brush tool come in handy for adding a bit of powder where you want it, fine tuning, and the spoolie is a good size for combing and bushing to a nice finish. I would love a taupe or blonde option for color because the brown is just not quite right. But, the shape and look of the brow is so good, I can tolerate the color. Also, maybe the darker color with blonde hair, is good!<br />This kit comes with a dark brown and light brown color, chestnut. The razor is cute but I still use tweezers.<br /><br />5 stars",5,5

It’s super cute with a trendy hat and wavy highlighted hair. It doesn’t feel awkward and strange on my head which wigs do as I really don’t know how to fix them up right but this one solves all that since it’s a hat. Total win. The hair isn’t the most realistic but it’s certainly not so bad if feel tacky wearing it out. You get some little extras with it as well which is nice.",5,5

"Water based mask that does not dry on skin. This is unlike any clay mask that I have ever used before. This product is water based and does not dry on my skin like most clay masks do. After I apply this to my face and leave it on for about 15 minutes, it still feels moist and slick when I go to rinse it off. The texture of this mask is more gel-like than it is clay. It feels lightweight and does not leave my skin feeling too dry and tight. This mask is effective enough for use during the winter, when my skin tends to be more dry. The product packaging looks attractive, but I wonder if they intentionally misspelled the word “moisturizing” as “moistorizing”.",3,5

The included invisible nylon hair net with elastic keeps every hair in place. The mesh in this cap is woven with nylon/spandex and keeps your head cool as it’s mesh design is wide enough to breathe.<br /><br />The velvety soft headband is on the thick side, but it holds so well. It has stretchability and velcro to adjust it tightly to your head. Both the net cap and headband are so easy to apply. I love the fact that the net cap holds your hair in place, no matter how thick your hair, it holds it all in nice and flat, while allowing your head to breathe.

"Lightweight moisturizer; absorbs rapidly; leaves skin moderately hydrated; smells lemony Even though this is baby lotion, I got this for me. This moisturizer is lightweight, slightly creamy, absorbs rapidly, and leaves my skin moderately hydrated. Since it is lightweight, it is a perfect summer lotion. To my senses, it has a mild lemony fragrance even though that is not listed in the ingredients. This is made of all plant-based ingredients (see photo). The current price of $16 is competitive but pricey for this 6.7 ounce tube.",4,5

It will allows them both to curl their hair on a single charge. My daughter really likes that it's cordless, because it lets her curl her hair on the ride to school.

"Life changer Update: The company emailed me back fairly quickly and comped a replacement unit. No hassle! Can't wait to get it. It's getting harder and harder to resist the call of the dreaded razor.<br /><br />I purchased this product several months ago and have used the epilator and callus sander attachments. The sander works the same as any other battery powered shaver. The epilator is a life changer though. The first time you use it is a bit rough if you haven't used one before, or get waxed. But I haven't had to pick up a razor since I started using this. Each time is easier, and the hairs grow back soft rather than the nasty stubble you get from shaving. Also, I've noticed less and less hair growing back. I could probably pluck the individual hairs on my legs if I had to.<br />Be warned though that the ingrown hair issue is real. If you do not exfoliate you will regret it. As to the battery life issue, when I first started using this I would be able to only do one whole leg before the battery started winding down. I could maybe get through both armpits and forearms on a single charge. But now there's so little hair that I can do everything on one charge (both legs from foot to groin, armpits and forearms).<br />With all this said, the device stopped working today.

"Thin mask, Hurts to peel off, but works well! Thinner than most black charcoal masks I've used. like it spreads thin too. Kinda hard to tell if enough is on.. So I feel like I use more than I should have to.. Will only probably get about 4-5 masks out of this tube.. Rather go back to my old one or try A new one which I love to do!<br /><br />But works well! I can see all the black heads it removes. Peels off in one piece.<br /> But **BEWARE!!**, don't get it in your hair. Is hard to get out without ripping it out lol and it kinda hurts to peel off in general. Not for sensitive skin!",3,5

"Great for my sensitive skin, great scent I love this soap so much. I use it for my body in the shower. It doesn't dry out my sensitive skin, it's scent is really pleasant and not strong, and it seems to last a while. Definitely will continue to purchase this soap and it's worth paying $12-13 for three bars in my opinion.",5,5

"Great for older skin I've used a lot of products over the years, but the last decade has been proven to be difficult finding ones that work for my 50+ skin and hair.<br /><br />I read the information for this mask and it sounded like a perfect match. I've used it for two weeks now and I'm really happy with it. It's a very hot pink color, but it feels super rich when you apply it. It doesn't pull really hard on your skin like some masks I've used and when you rinse it off, your skin looks and feels refreshed.<br /><br />Like my mom, I have large pores which is why I use masks. This absolutely works for that. It also helps to reduce oil without drying. That's a problem I've encountered with some masks. They reduce oil at the expense of my skin getting flaky. This mask also has a pleasant aroma. It's not perfumey either, just a light scent.<br /><br />I hope this stay around for a while. I finally found something I'm happy with and will continue to use. I just hope it stays in production!",5,5

"Love this brush! I have moderately thick but very fine hair. I've been taking extra time and good care of my hair these past couple of years since I turned 60, and that is why I can say my hair is moderately thick. I found that a quality shampoo and conditioner help tremendously in maintaining body and appearance. I brush my hair at least 50 strokes nightly and in the morning at least 25 strokes with boar's hair brush. The shampoo, conditioner and brushing definitely improved the condition of my hair. But this Brush with its Pure Wild Boar Bristle and Massage Tip Bristle Combination feels very nice on my scalp. I personally prefer the round handle and the round shape of the head. As I write this review, I am buying another, because something this good usually disappears from the market or becomes unreasonably priced. All my many other Boar's hair brushes will go to storage. This is my new &#34;GO TO&#34; brush.",5,5
"The best sunscreen Panama Jack is the best sunscreen there is. I went to the beach in Florida for a week. I had no tan at all. I spent nearly all my time outdoors with this sunscreen on me. I didn't burn. I am a fair skinned white lady. With no sunscreen I would have started turning pink in just a few minutes. With this Panama Jack Sport SPF 50 I was able to enjoy the beach, gulf, pool, lounging, all without the pain of a sunburn. This doesn't feel greasy at all. It rubs in and skin just feels natural. Apply before going out. After that you can reapply while outside.",5,5

"NOT AS ADVERTISED. VERY DISAPPOINTED. 🤯 So the ad clearly says there's 8 pieces and so does the packaging. Well mine only came with 5 and they weren't even secured by the gold tie either. I'm missing a second single weft, a second triple weft, and a second quadruple weft. Not to mention they are all rolled up and STUCK in the position (as pictured) the packaging was very basic and boring and didnt even have the companies name or logo on it. Yes the extensions are soft and some wefts are thicker than others but they are also all frizzy. I did a lot of searching this time, and I mean like for days, before I finally decided on which set I was going to buy, and I'm not overly happy this time. Rather, a little disappointed actually. I've bought much cheaper extensions from amazon a few times throughout the years, and this one is lower on my list of recommendations.<br /><br />**UPDATE**<br />So here we are on November 8 2019, and I'm still in a back and forth argument with INMANY HAIR about just re-sending the package for compensation. The ad clearly states, repeatedly, how many pieces are included, not to mention that the ONLY wording on the entire package itself is simply and very clearly 8 PIECES. My issue has yet to be resolved in any way. Thew only offer I recieved from them was a $12 credit to my account. WHAT?! Where does that number even come from?!!!!! I'm so not happy at this moment. 😤😠",1,3
"Top quality cleanser I love oil based cleansers and don't use anything else. But they are not for everyone. My 20 year old daughter doesn't like this product, while I think it's one of the best I've used. The smell is subtle and I love the suppleness of my skin after cleaning!",5,5

What a relief! I don’t know about you but I have been having dry hands from lots of hand sanitizer. And my poor cuticles.

I only need to use it once or twice a day.,5,5

"Decent moisturizing conditioner My hair is dry and damaged from bleaching and I try to do all I can to keep it happy and healthy. I shampooed my hair, towel dried and added conditioner to my hair and combed it through. I put on a shower cap and a towel wrap and slept on it. In the morning I rinsed it out and let it air dry. It felt reasonably moisturized and looked good. I usually wash twice a week and switch between conditioner and hair mask. The scent is different than any I have smelled in a conditioner, but it isn't bad and it doesn't really stay around. There was no seal on the conditioner and it was all over the box when I got it, but it was only a little bit.",4,5
Disappointed I saw all the Facebook videos showing how effective this silicone sponge would be at applying foundation and other makeup. This didn't work for me at all. It doesn't have a lot of flex to it and the spread over the skin isn't even.,1,1

"Flower very nice, but birdcage veil difficult to handle I purchased this for my upcoming wedding. The flower (called a ""fascinator"" in the bridal industry, I'm learning) is very nice, and I will definitely wear it. I may cut the wires with the bling off, but that's just me. I'm having a simple summer picnic wedding with a white, cotton halter dress, and the bling might be a bit too much. I am going to ask my best friend before making this decision. Either way, it's a nice piece.<br /><br />The birdcage veil, though, wasn't really how it's pictured. In the photo it seems to have a lot more conformity to a human head than the actual piece that showed up in my mailbox. The real thing starts out unruly, and popped up in weird places on my head. I tried calming the thing down with bobby pins, but it still looked unshapely. Finally, though, after watching the company's videos (they give you a piece of paper with a link to some instructional videos) and keeping it near the shower for a few days to get it to calm down, it did actually look good. I have a large head with puffy hair, and I found that if I put the comb towards the back of my head on the right, and allow the veil to come up over top my head from the back right, hanging down around my face, that the veil's large size is actually an asset, because it covers my puffy hair without flattening it.<br /><br />I was so worried about the veil that I ordered a separate, handmade birdcage veil from etsy for $30 (see it at pompandplumage.com) that I hoped would be more what I'm looking for. When it arrived, though, it was too small to wear without wearing my puffy hairstyle slicked back, which isn't how I plan to wear my hair. I actually went back to the cheaper veil I bought here on amazon.<br /><br />Whatever you end up doing with the veil portion, the flower/fascinator is nice enough, and cheap enough, that it's still worth the purchase. The flower/fascinators on the same site on etsy where I purchase the other birdcage veil, pompandplumage.com, are $60-$70, and look similar, so even without the veil, this was a good deal.",4,4

"New to using Argan oil, and love this one! I thought I would give Argan oil a shot after having some success with coconut oil as a moisturizer. I chose this one because it was organic and cold pressed. I am blown away! I have never been able to use chemical ridden beauty products...they just make me break out. Coconut oil helped a little with the breakouts, but was too greasy. Argan oil is AMAZING. I've been using about a month now, and today I am proudly going to work without any concealer on! There is NOTHING to conceal! It's helped to calm my breakouts, but has also lessened the appearance of some fine lines that have started appearing (I'm in my mid 30's). I even used it on my hair to tame some fly aways with great success. I think I'm in love!",5,5

"GOOD BUT NOT ALWAYS GREAT I loved this shampoo and conditioner for the first several weeks that I purchased it again.<br />However, after continued use it seemed to have a build up on my hair weighing it down<br />and causing frizz on the thinner front of my hair.

"I love this thing! I've had this for almost three years and I love it. I'm surprised other reviewers don't like it because I find it works great. I have athlete's foot and my feet get all dry and cracked and disgusting. I can't seem to get rid of it, even with prescription cream. I use this once a week, when I get out of the shower so the skin is softened up a bit. It never powers down. In fact, my only problem is I'm so enthusiastic about removing dead skin that sometimes I overuse it and cut myself, which is painful but my own fault.<br />One of the only truly indispensable appliances I own!",5,5
"Slinky of Pain. Hurts like a mother, but works really good. This thing is awesome. yes it hurts, but no more than plucking, and you can grab a bunch of chin hairs all at once so the pain only lasts a nanosecond. It's harder on moustache hair because it's more sensitive and once it grabs on you are at the moment of no return and you have to go through with it and sometimes I cry a little but it really gets those dang hairs out of there. Much quicker than plucking. i haven't used any of the other things they put in there. Just the slinky of pain",5,5

I don't know why I decided to try something different. I guess because I like YES products. However, this conditioner weighs my hair down without really helping minimize static. When I brush my hair, it sticks to the sides of my face. I hate it when that happens. And because its a heavy conditioner, I feel like Ihave to wash my hair everyday. Something I can usually put off for 3-4 days in the dry winter. Also, it doesn't get eliminate tangles as well as Humectress. Going back to Humectress.",3,5

"great shave The only thing better that I have tried is the PolSilver Super Iridium, but those are licensed by Gillette and more expensive, because of the rare metal, they last a long time. However, these Russian blades are most excellent, and I can afford to swap out blades often to avoid potential skin problems. They are as good a shave as any I've tried, and they leave my face very smooth. I tried 2 blades in a sampler pack and was sold, I ordered off for a pile of them.",5,5

"Awesome Kit of Generously-Sized Minis! This travel set of products is a complete winner for me, and the sizes are generous for minis. I love the vials of the Priming Water and the Prime Essence. I actually prefer these two items more than the tube of primer itself, although it is good too. The two liquid products go on so thin and seamlessly, that it’s the perfect amount of primer to smooth everything out and help the foundation last. Sometimes full-on primers can be a bit too smoothing and it makes me feel like my makeup is going to slide off. Everything is very mildly scented (a mix of fresh & floral), but not overwhelming and the scent doesn’t stick around. The No Pore-Blem primer is nice and works well to smooth out specific zones on my face, but I don't use it all the time. For all over coverage, I prefer the Priming Water, followed by the Prime Essence, which makes my skin look and feel great, and helps my foundation look awesome.",5,5
