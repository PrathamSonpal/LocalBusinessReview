Nice set for a facial treat This set is great for a nice facial massage. I like using the roller over my safety makes to make sure they stay in place and help the serum into my skin. The cool feeling of the stone is super soothing. The gua sha is a nice massage with a moisturizer or serum too. It comes nicely presented and would make a great gift.,positive,positive

Dont work to keep water out of ears in the shower. Description said can use in shower to keep water out of ears ....Not! They just rest on the tops of the ear...water pressure just knocks them off. Probably work pretty good for hair coloring....but not what I need.,negative,negative

"I hate the term dreadlock, but I love these accessories. I hate the term dreadlock because I do not dread my hair. I love my hair, the term dreadlock was started by the British who dreaded seeing the Jamaicans the ones they call maroons, come down the hill when they were trying to go up the hill to get them. This is a beautiful set of decorations to go on your lovelocks and some of them really rock. I recommend my friend. Thank you. God bless you and may the rest of your life be the best of your life.

"The product came quickly and was easy to put on I bought for my two bar stools. I did not read the reviews or questions thoroughly enough to realize that these rings would keep the chairs stationary. I'm unable to slide the chairs out, you have to pick up and move them as the rubber creates friction. The product came quickly and was easy to put on, hence the 5-star review. I've since requested a return/ refund as this product does not suit my needs. I'll update this review if any issues with customer service.",positive,negative

"Leaves your skin a bit sticky and not huge on the scent but works The Iryasa Face Cream comes in a little jar, which is not my favorite container since you obviously dip into it all the time. So I tend to wash my hands before I do that so I don't introduce dirt and such into it because that can shorten the life span of these products.<br /><br />The cream itself is actually a little heavy which was surprising since it looked light and airy. It has some nice natural ingredients in it which is great. I wasn't too crazy about the smell of it though but that is because it used Geranium essential oil, which is probably one of my least favorite but I was hoping that the lemon would help cover it but it still powered through a lot.<br /><br />The cream absorbs fairly quickly into your skin and but leaves a sticky residue on your skin that doesn't seem to fade for quite some time. Thankfully by using this at night you won't know since you add this last thing before you go to bed and then just fall asleep. It does add moisture to your skin so in the morning your skin does feel pretty nice.",positive,positive

Disappointing! One sided printing. These would have been kept and not sent back if the printing design was actually on both sides. Instead you are left with a blank white side on one side of the hair ruffles. Very silly. So disappointing. Sent back before I even left on my tropical trip. Did not see within any photos or description that the artwork was only one-sided. Also these were not cheap. The edges will also fray in time in my opinion. Would be nice if printing was one both sides of fabric.,negative,negative

"This brush is amazing and does exactly what it advertises This brush is amazing and does exactly what it advertises. I don't hear hair breakage as it glides through my hair. I purchased a different brand about 3 years ago and the brush head was too round and too big, but this one seems to be a good size and fits into a purse just fine. I bought a second one to use on my dog as she has long hair & it gets tangled very easily. She actually gets excited when it's time to brush her now.",positive,positive
Painless shave This hair removal works amazing. It actually removes the hair and you dont feel the pull like you do with most small hair . this can fit in your pocket or purse. Its quick and painless. Very easy to clean. Just unscreaw the top and it comes out in a hair roll. Once clean close and store or use. It holds a good amount of hair per shave so you get a lot done. I tested it on my leg 1st before trying anywhere else and it truly works amazing,positive,positive

"Just the perfect size & weight for my purse Evolve Boar Bristle Purse Size Brush<br /> I needed a new brush for my purse & now I have one! Just the perfect size & weight for my purse. Lightweight yet sturdy. No plastic! This brush would also be perfect for a toddler's hair or an elderly person's thin hair. No sharp edges to poke you!<br /> I have never had a boar's hair brush so I suppose there is a bald boar running around somewhere! Not in my neighborhood, I hope!!<br /> I just hope I don't lose this brush! I have a hard time keeping brushes. Usually, I lose them. Sometimes my cat decides he likes my brush, so I give in. He needs to stay out of my purse!<br /> I'm hoping this brush works out. Then I will graduate up to the larger sizes. I think the plastic brushes are rough on my hair & pull some hair out.<br /> So far, I'm loving this brush. It really smooths & tames my hair down If you want a natural soft brush, this is the one for you. I don't use this brush on wet hair. I switched over to a wide tooth comb. My plastic brushes are in the trash!!<br /> I did receive this brush at a reduced cost for an honest opinion. I love it! Thank You!!",positive,positive

"Similar Masks, but ALL are Delightful This brand of mask is not off the chart expensive, but it's always helpful to try things out before making the big investment.<br />What a terrific way to try the various masks that this company offers! The quad pack includes skin resurrection for rejuvenating, chillax for calming, magic mushroom for moisturizing, and glow and go for brightening.<br />Perfect for a pajama parties with a spa theme!<br />The ingredients are similar in all of them. They all contain skin-loving aloe vera as well as cucumber extract, and even manuka honey. And all of them are pleasantly scented and very refreshing to use.",positive,positive
Softer feet Pros : my feet Start peeling right away as soon as water hits my feet. still peeling after 7th day you just need to be patience before wearing those cute sandals to show off your new exfoliated soft feet my first time using foot mask I shared one pack with a friend I have not gave myself a pedicure in months and was worth it will use again and will recommend<br /><br />Cons: foot mask bootie plastic needs to be long or higher in coverage it will spill out through socks hold feet downward but off floor so mask solution won’t leak,positive,positive

"Exquisite and rich This Cardea Luxe skin care eye renewal therapy 1.8oz jar would make a wonderful gift for someone you care about like your mom, your sister, or a close friend. The jar and package shout &quot;quality&quot; and this product does not disappoint. The three inch high, eight inch around glass container boasts two shiny silver metal rings around top bringing a sense of timelessness and class. The white top pump mechanism is a wonderful touch ...so handy and sensible. You push down and just the right amount of the lovely, anti -oxidant eye cream is released. Let me tell you, the feel of that crème as it touches your hands is so exquisite and rich, it soaks right into your skin, leaving your hands feeling like they have been truly pampered at last. I know this is eye crème but it is doing wonders for my hands! It is no less magnificent when I use it on my face. It is hydrating and nourishing around my eyes, all over my face, and on my neck and Décolleté area. You can throw out all your neck creams, face creams, etc. and just use this Cardea Luxe skin care eye renewal therapy crème for everything! I have not yet tried it on my feet but I will ! I hope you try it and enjoy. It's very soothing and a delight for all your skin.",positive,positive

"Nice variety, seem to be durable At this price, this set is a good value in terms of quantity, variety of styles and sturdiness. I've only had them for a few days so I can't say for sure that they're going to be durable, but I did slam them repeatedly on my tile floors with far more force than with the impact of simply falling, and they're still in tact.<br /><br />I have thin hair and the clips grasp nicely and wear comfortably. They open wide enough that I'm sure they'll work for thick hair, too.<br /><br />The colors were a little off, at least on my monitor. The one that looks gold on my screen is actually a light tan. I will probably never wear it out of the house. It looks awful with my red hair and I can't think of many outfits it would match either. That's why the set loses a star for me. The brownish one is lighter than pictured, too.",positive,neutral

See my picture for a list of ingredients. Even though it is 70% alcohol it did not leave my skin feeling dried out.

adorable and functional I bought this for my 5-year-old goddaughter after she saw that I was using one similar to it. She LOVES it and carries it with her everywhere.

"Love this brush! I have moderately thick but very fine hair. I've been taking extra time and good care of my hair these past couple of years since I turned 60, and that is why I can say my hair is moderately thick. I found that a quality shampoo and conditioner help tremendously in maintaining body and appearance. I brush my hair at least 50 strokes nightly and in the morning at least 25 strokes with boar's hair brush. The shampoo, conditioner and brushing definitely improved the condition of my hair. But this Brush with its Pure Wild Boar Bristle and Massage Tip Bristle Combination feels very nice on my scalp. I personally prefer the round handle and the round shape of the head. As I write this review, I am buying another, because something this good usually disappears from the market or becomes unreasonably priced. All my many other Boar's hair brushes will go to storage. This is my new &#34;GO TO&#34; brush.",positive,positive

"Minty & Cooling, Heavy & Doesn’t Absorb Well, Agitates My Sensitive Skin-Some Good Ingredients ﻿I’m in my 50’s and have dry, sensitive skin and also have some contact allergies. This Murad Hydration Intense Recovery Cream is pale green and has a nice, light spearmint scent that may be from mint oils, such as Mentha Viridis Leaf Oil and Mentha Arvensis Leaf Oil, as chemical fragrance isn’t listed. This cream has an unusual balmy texture that feels slippery and silky. It oddly feels like it just sits on top of my dry skin rather being absorbed. It’s not greasy, but it feels heavy like a barrier cream. I’m not crazy about that feel. I do like that it’s thick and has somewhat of a firming feel.<br /><br />I’d be okay with the texture at night (not for daytime), but this cream imparts a strong cooling sensation (possibly from mint oil as this is alcohol free) that doesn’t feel pleasing to me. Instead of feeling soothing and calming, it feels stimulating and kind of agitating. My skin gets itchy and prickly, so I’ve had to wash it off as my skin feels uncomfortable and like it might blister or get a rash (though it hasn’t in the short time I’ve left it on). It feels better rubbed on my arm, so maybe it’s good for other skin types.<br /><br />I can’t gauge how well this hydrates as I had to discontinue use. It has some good stuff like apple fruit extract (scavenges free radicals) and algae (antioxidant and hydration). It also has moisturizing and/or soothing ingredients, such as glycerin, vitamin E, butylene glycol, macadamia nut oil and shea butter. However, it also has known sensitizers, such as spearmint and mint oils, that get “poor” ratings by Paula’s Choice. This generally seems like a quality cream, but it feels heavy and irritating to my sensitive skin. 3.5 stars.",neutral,positive

I would give these ZERO stars if I could and then I would make it negative stars for the horrific customer service of Maya Beauty that just added insult to injury. These have a very dangerous sharp metal barb protruding from the hook and it cut my arm (it literally bled and left a scar) and damaged my hair. I have bungees I purchased from Rickys that are beautifully crafted and only 2 dollars more.

In that 3rd pic, the first piece of hair is out of the pack, not washed or dyed; the second piece of hair is the bleached portion, and the third piece is just cowashed.

"Actual Holy Grail I read a review that said everyone would hug you with this stuff on. Since there’s a quarantine on, I haven’t tested that theory but it does smell really good. It goes on woody/herbaceous but mellows to this indescribable creamy yumminess. Full disclosure: it may be the combination of this deodorant and the “unscented” aloe/goat soap by same brand (it has a slight scent tho). I don’t know. But since using this, I never stink. Even after a workout and/or a long sweaty day. My pits smell as yummy at bedtime as the did out of the shower (a FIRST for my adult life). Oh! And I have sensitive skin and this is the BEST I’ve used: Zero irritation even though it has a slight grainy texture.<br />I started rubbing it on my scalp it smells so good (Sorry TMI). BTW, I’ve tried DOZENS of natural paraben-free deodorants so, I know of what I speak. Holy grail.",positive,positive

"smells nice First and foremost- this is a cream deodorant. If you have never used a cream it is basically rubbing lotion into your arms pits (anyone remember Tussy deodorant?) We gave this a go and it smells really nice- a little strong (Jasmine has a very strong sweet scent), but pleasant. Did not irritate the skin at all and pretty much stopped odor (we did have a very sweaty 1.5 hour workout and by the end of that we were pretty stinky). For normal daily use this works just fine and keeps you stink free. It does leave a bit of a challenge residue on clothes so watch out for sleeveless clothing.",positive,positive

"If you want news anchor hair this is your product I buy this for my husband who loves hair products. He was getting one from Dollar Shave Club that he can no longer get.

I like that fact that even when he's a little heavy handed with the product, it doesn't look like a helmet. He likes it better than the DSC product he was getting.

"Must buy! Holy cow! This stuff is AMAZING! I just ran out of a expensive tinted sunscreen & was looking for something with the same affect but cheaper. Saw the reviews & gave it a shot. First off let me state that I’m a full coverage type of girl. I have freckles, discoloration & some scars I like hiding when I do wear makeup. I never thought I would even consider something light weight or sheer. But now as a mom, barely have time for my glam makeup, & wanted something to protect my aging skin this stuff is great! IM 26 but want to start taking care of my skin better. I’m usually the color porcelain but wanted something with color. The natural glow gave me that sun kissed glow without looking orange. Non shimmery what-so ever. Matt but non drying, no oily texture. Gave me such a natural glow. GORG! I wore this all day for Easter at the park (never thought I wouldn’t wear foundation to a family event!) & got tons of compliments how I look refreshed. I’m glowing & my skin hasn’t looked better! I will 100% be buying this for as long as they continue this product!<br /><br />2 MONTH UPDATE: Still am amazing product! Use it almost everyday now. I even tried it under my foundation& works wonderfully! I swear it made my foundation look better. Like others posted, the pumped stopped working on me. I now have to open the container to get the product out. Not that big of a deal but a bummer. But overall, will be purchasing again when I run out... which seems like a month or two more.",positive,positive
Great Product that Does Not Disappoint 👍😍 This product is absolutely amazing! My brows are extremely thin and sparse. This pen did the trick. It's a plus too that the end results are smudge proof. I would definitely recommend this product. The picture included is me without any other makeup and ONLY the eyebrow pen after working ten hours. Look. Still there. I love it so much that I ordered another one. It's a keeper!,positive,positive

"Very Pretty Victorian BUT Need To Off Gas - Wont Order Again These are so pretty & very nicely made. The big problem is the horrible toxic chemical odor.

They hold my very long straight hair well & do not tangle. They are even packaged in a tidy little round plastic case with a screw top lid. There are 2 of each of five different subtle & soft colors.

"Relatively strong water flosser but reservoir is attached which makes drying it nearly impossible I have used various countertop water flossers in the past such as the countertop WaterPik and the [[ASIN:B07HRNGS3Q Truwell Handheld Water Flosser]]. I love the idea of a hand held irrigator and this does work to remove most stuck debris from between the teeth. What is nice about this one over the other handheld I tried, is that there is very little splash back. However, I personally do not like that the reservoir is not removable for drying.<br /><br />IN THE PACKAGE<br />- One reservoir attached to handheld flosser unit<br />- One USB cable (wall adapter NOT included)<br />- One instruction manual<br />- One standard jet nozzle<br />- One orthodontic nozzle (larger brush)<br />- One pocket nozzle (smaller brush)<br />- One tong scraping nozzle (what looks like a spoon)<br /><br />I charged the unit fully before use. The white light on the side blinks when charging and remains steady when it is fully charged. Note the charging port is hidden behind a silicone nub below the grip dots on the top of the unit. Be careful to cover the charging port with this nub when the flosser is in use.<br /><br />There is an on/off switch and a mode switch. The three water pressure modes are soft, standard, and massage can be cycled through using the mode switch prior to turning the unit on. The jet tip (or any of the other three tips) gets inserted into the top. Be careful to make sure it is seated with the notch in the groove as the first time I put it in the hole, I did not have it seated all the way. To eject, press the release button to the left side.<br /><br />The reservoir IS NOT removable. Instead water enters through the small opening on bottom through which one has to fill the unit. I do not like that the reservoir is attached as I have to drain the remaining water out of that hole and leave the door open for drying. Also, the little button through which the water enters can easily break after lots of use. I personally would prefer not to have to use that hole.<br /><br />I held my mouth almost totally closed during use and tried all three modes. I did not have splash back, which was very nice. Splash back is usually typical of almost any type of water flosser so to some extent I was surprised. This flosser does work to dislodge most debris between teeth but not everything because it is not super powerful but is powerful enough. I am also impressed that the manual is relatively well written; kudos to the manufacturer on this. Normally, I feel as if I am reading Pig Latin when I receive products from China or other countries.<br /><br />In summary, my biggest disappointment with this unit is the attached reservoir that prevents me from drying this out easily.",positive,positive

"Vibrant mostly shimmery colors more for women with a darker complexion I wish I could wear these colors but most of them are too deeply hued for my fair complexion. I tried several of the colors and many make my eyes look swollen and puffy as if I had an eye infection. If I had olive or brown skin, I think these colors would look awesome. The only colors I was able to wear in this pallet are the pearl, volcano, bronze, sunset, 24k, and ash. I absolutely love the shimmer on many of these. I like that the ""compact pallet holder"" has a magnetic closure. Eye applicators have to be purchased separately. Despite this, I think $7.88 is a great price for this selection. The colors that I did apply stayed put all day.<br /><br />The 15 colors starting from top row left to right and working down are:<br />- copper<br />- cinnamond<br />- pearl<br />- golden<br />- bronze<br />- volcano<br />- sunset<br />- pumpkin<br />- 24k<br />- moch<br />- fleshy<br />- mermaid<br />- rose<br />- ash<br />- ginger",positive,positive

Thank goodness for a very knowledgeable woman of color who’d dealt with worse telling me about these. It took hours, but little pain and the nest was undone. Cheers to amazon for having these (use them daily now), and shame on most retailers for carrying little to nothing like it, or anything pertaining to “ethnic” hair and makeup. Not only could everyone benefit from such items, but even if they didn’t, why exclude more than half the population?! Yah for amazon (in this case).",positive,positive

"Too rough to use every day, but nice once in a while I ordered this 3-pack of Salux towels for the shower to help with rough bumpy skin on the backs of my legs, and to have an easy way to scrub my back.<br /><br />They take some getting used to, partially because they're so long and don't immediately lather like sponges do. I prefer to keep it folded, wet it, add some soap or shower gel, and rub/scrunch it together until a lather forms. I used it folded on my body, and then unfold it to full length to use on my back (like the picture shows). You have to keep it out of the stream of water, or else the soap will wash right out of it.<br /><br />They were definitely much more harsh than I expected - I can only use them very gently, and can't use them at all on especially thin areas of skin like my shins, the tops of my feet, or my chest. I'd absolutely never use them on my face or neck.<br /><br />After the first use, I noticed an immediate improvement to my bumpy skin. But after I began to scrub with them daily, I felt like it actually exacerbated the problem. Plus, it was just another item to keep in the bathroom and worry about washing every week. As a side note, I wish they made these in white or grey instead of the bright colors - I feel like they'd match so many more peoples' bathroom decor and I wouldn't feel as bad about leaving one lying around the bathroom.<br /><br />Now, I just use a Salux once per week as an exfoliating treatment - they're definitely too strong to be an everyday thing for me, but it does the job and helps with my bumps overall.",positive,positive

I did not have to use very much...just a bit...the jar will last a long time It did exactly what I hoped! Light coverage (exact match to my skin tone -- probably the same for everyone since there is only one tint) and my skin took on a glow.<br /><br />I am 71 years old, so my skin has seen better days. I have used many skin care products, but this is the best. There is no need for another moisturizer. I hope this product continues to be available.

"The Real ""Miracle In A Jar"" For Me! I've been a user of the Alpha Hydrox products for several years. I'm 38 going on 39, and some people still mistake me for 25 to early 30's. I especially love the 12% Souffle cream. Trust me, if you purchase this product, it will work SO well that you may take it for granted someday. Don't! I made that mistake, and it almost cost me my skin!<br /><br />I had run out of the souffle and was lazy one day when repurchasing my skin care products, so I bought a drugstore brand of a popular new ""Simply Radiant"" skin care system with fancy ""Soy Proteins"" in it. I wanted to even out my skin tone (African-American, with a couple of dark dots left over from a few small pimples). After using the moisturizer for a week, I started developing cystic acne-type bumps on my face!! BIG pus-filled lumps that developed in clusters on my cheeks and forehead. I was horrified. I immediately stopped using the moisturizer, and the cysts stopped developing, but the damage was done; I had slowly-healing cystic acne bumps on my face. When I returned the cream to the drug store, the clerk took one look at me and quickly gave me my money back; the bad skin reaction was that obvious.<br /><br />I ordered the Alpha Hydrox 12% Souffle as soon as I could, along with the Alpha Hydrox 14% AHA swipes to help accelerate my skin exfoliation. I used the swipes 3 times a week, and the souffle morning and night. After a month, I finally got the acne under control. After two months, my skin was smooth again. After six months, I was able to take the most gorgeous headshots I've ever had done, and the graphic artist only had to retouch ""shine"" on my forehead and chin. There's only a pinhead-sized indentation left over from the acne scars, and all the deep-colored hyperpigmented spots have completely healed and disappeared. My skin is baby-smooth, even toned, and if I had told you that approximately eight months ago I had deep acne scars on my face, you would never believe me.<br /><br />I'm back to just the Souffle morning and evening for maintenance, but I'll NEVER take using my Alpha Hydrox products for granted ever again!",positive,positive

But I used them to decorate the inside of what I used as a Mother’s Day gift box to hide my moms diamond earrings inside of one and her diamond necklace in the other. The white flowers had a lot of red on them which I don’t understand because it was only one red rose in the box. I put a quarter on top of one so you can estimate the size, my pic makes them look bigger. They are MINI sized but I knew that. I think they should be a lot less as far as the price goes maybe 5.99 the gift box is cute though.",neutral,positive
"For The Price, Hard Pass I purchased the .3 ounce tube (the small tube, whatever size it is) and it definitely wasn't worth the $17 that it cost.<br /><br />The cream isn't bad, per se. Though it was difficult to tell if it was really working since it only lasted about two weeks of nightly applications (being EXTREMELY stingy with the amount used). In that time my skin didn't have any bad reaction and maybe seemed a bit more uniform. But not enough to justify shelling out $60 for a full tub of the cream.<br /><br />The odor took some getting used to, but it isn't pungent. It just isn't pleasant. Has a very medicinal/bitter scent.<br /><br />It did seem like a quality cream, but, again, no idea if it works. And I don't plan to spend the crazy amount for more. I'll stick to the Neutrogena Deep Wrinkle night cream, which does work (quite well, I might add) and is a literal fraction of the cost.",negative,neutral

"Smells Good, But Nah I enjoyed the smell of this Jagat almond oil. It reminds me of the royal hair grease that I used as a kid. I’ve never tried this type of oil before and usually just add jojoba as my hair oil leave in. The consistency of the Jagat was very watery, but perhaps that’s how it’s supposed to be? I do question the amount of actual almond oil this has though, because it’s listed as the 3rd ingredient with mineral oil being the first. Anyway, I tested a good amount on my hands before trying it on my head and I’m so glad I did. I do not like this at all. It made my hands tingle, itch and slightly feel like they were burning. The sensation lasted a good 15 minutes after I had washed the product off. If you don’t have sensitive skin this maybe fine, but it’s a nah for me.",neutral,positive

"takes a long while to work I have been using this in hopes to make my 5.5 incher a bit longer. So far I have been using it for the past 2.5 years on average of 3 hours 5 times a week. It requires dedication and commitment in order to get any results. Even though i have been using it for 2.5 years I have seen very little difference. After i have it on for 3 hours my penis looks longer flaccid for a few minutes because it had been stretched out. Within a few minute it reverts back to its tiny size. When erect I can honestly say I dont see any difference at all. It hurts if you put it on incorrectly and can be very fiddly. For men who have a smaller head it is very difficult for the contraption to stay on as it continually slips off. I only use it when i am in bed or at home. A few times i wore it to work and within 30 min of arrival i had to take it off because it started hurting really bad. The logic behind the contraption seems to make sense , stretch the skin to produce more cellular structure, but that takes time even years to work. I have not given up on the contraption and I am still using it 3 hours a day. I am sure if i used it longer hours it may work quicker but for me after 3 hours My penis just cant take the pain anymore. Good luck guys.",neutral,neutral

"Long-lasting, lots of 'suds' and great grit gardener's soap! Had a bar like this for several years. Didn't know where I got it, so ...looked around, found this...which looked similar. It was the same soap! This is a hard-edged TOUGH bar of soap that gets rid of EVERYTHING! Cuts through grease like magic, has a nice, strong scent, and the grit scrubs off the most stubborn dirt/grime from the garden. Careful...it'll dry out your skin if you over use it, but it's perfect if you're looking to get out soil and/or oils from outdoor work. Doesn't take much to get it going, either. A rub or two gets you enough soap to lather up AND grit off whatever you're trying to manage. HIGHLY recommend this.",positive,positive

Good product to aid in look/texturing hair I've used this product for about ten years along with several other products at the same time. My favorite thickening cream is no longer made so I've bumped to using this all the time. It does a decent job of providing lift when combined with drying your hair using a lifting technique. I've tried many products in search of a thickening 'cream' but none currently on the market do as good a job as this. The price on this is also good compared to other products.,positive,positive
"Has worked well for me (Right about 3.5 stars)<br />As others have mentioned, this trimmer suffers from a bad stand design; you cannot charge it while it's in the stand. Frankly I don't bother with the stand at all; the trimmer and accessories stay in a drawer in my bathroom where they can't gather dust.<br />I mostly use the G250 for nose and ear hair removal. It does a decent job at trimming with this attachment. One noticeable downside for trimming ear hair is the noise: it's just a bit too loud to be comfortable. (Might just be my noise tolerance is low, as I grew up on the edge of a pine forest in Maine.)

"Perfect Gift Set I'm a true skincare addict. I really like these holiday sets. They're a good way to try new products. Caudalie is a cult favorite for a reason. Their products are made from the grapes in their vineyards. You get all the benefits of the resveratrol in pretty packaging. This set comes with a moisturizer, serum and foaming cleanser. They come in travel sizes, so it's just enough to decide whether you like them or not. This set is a great value. It makes the perfect gift. As a note, my box was a bit banged up. The products weren't properly glued to the base, so they came out in the shipping package. Other than that, I highly recommend this set.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.",positive,positive

Ouch!! Where’s my skin!! These work ok but as with some of the other purchasers this completely ripped my skin off! I followed all instructions had clean skin applied one side first then to the other. I didn’t pull the skin too firm. I did have to keep making sure my hair covered my neck when wearing as you can still see the tape. I went out for 4 hours and this is what happened. The picture is 4 days after the incident. I didn’t want to horrify anyone because it was gross and weepy.,negative,negative
"I love these nails, but... I bought this because I was wanting to try fiberglass without spending a ton on something I might hate. I definitely do not hate these nails! They are thin and natural looking, and still super strong. I will absolutely continue using fiberglass nails.<br /><br />BUT... They are a bit of a pain to use, and some of that pain is actual, physical pain from getting fiberglass stuck in your skin. I'd advise using gloves, and will follow my own advice on that going forward. Fiberglass is actual wee little glass fibers which are nearly impossible to see and remove when you get a bit stuck in your skin and can be really irritating and painful. I ended up smearing my hands with tacky glue, letting it dry, and then peeling it off to get rid of the it. It worked pretty well, but yeah, gloves.<br /><br />The gel in this set cured well, and as I said, my nails are very strong. I used Young Nails Protien Bond and the base coat, and so far no lifting whatsoever, when I usually would start seeing some.<br /><br />The little LED light is cute, but I wouldn't ever use it for curing nails. I have a better light and I halved the recommending curing times since they're given for the tiny lamp.<br /><br />There's a little tin of loose fibers, which I'm not sure how to use.<br /><br />The set also comes with two completely useless pairs of tweezers, which I just tossed.",positive,positive

"Works for some mini polishes, too I received this product discounted in exchange for a review--I state this disclaimer upfront because that's what I would want to know first, and I too am disturbed by the ratings inflation on Amazon for IEF reviews lately. I do not indiscriminately give 5star reviews, and they are only given for a fraction of products I try that I find are exceptional and I would buy myself at FULL price. If you wish not to view IEF reviews such as this, click on the filter link to the right of the review section, and then click on &#34;verified purchases only&#34;; that will take most of them out.<br /><br />Well, I'm overall pretty pleased with this product. I got it hoping I could use it to organize some of my nail polish minis, and it does hold much of my collection. The mini OPI bottles for the most part fit in the lipstick columns, though not all the way in, for some (strangely enough, the Nordic Collection ones are just a smidge smaller and go in smoothly, despite supposedly being the same exact size). That was the main purpose of me getting this, so I'm pleased. I know it was made for other types of makeup, but I already have a system for them; it was all my loose polishes that were driving me nuts. Please note that you won't get many full-size polishes to fit, though the Essie square type bottles make it easier to get as many in as possible. As you can see, I had to put some big bottles upside-down to fit more in. It still had room for my nail brushes, file, foils, tapes, glitters, and cotton balls in the bottom. The material is a very clear acrylic, but it doesn't feel too cheap. One complaint I have is the drawers can get a little stuck; but this is common with these acrylic drawers. Also, the top pc is separate from the bottom drawers, which I don't like. But these are all minor complaints. Overall, pleased it does the job.",positive,positive

"Simple to Use & Perfect Results Every Time!! I LOVE these bun makers!! I have an old bun maker that I've been using for years, but that one just got tossed in the trash because these new ones are SO much easier to use and the finished product looks much better!! These bun makers are unique in that they are foam, which helps to grip your hair to better hold it in place. They also have a very strong inner wire that holds them in place in a perfect circle. I have relatively long (just past my bust line) hair with long layers - the trick to getting all of the end pieces of the layers to stay tucked in place is to pull the bun maker down the length of your ponytail just before you reach the end of the shortest layer. Then, fold all of the rest of the ends upward over the hair piece and tuck them inward towards the center of the ponytail. As you roll the hair piece upwards, continue to tuck any loose ends in so that they are held in place by the rolled hair. The other trick to getting a perfectly round bun is that once you have rolled the hair piece all the way up with your hair, fold the ends inward towards each other to form a circle, but make sure to tighten this circle as much as possible by pushing the ends as close together as you can. Otherwise, these hair pieces are fairly self-explanatory to use, and there are step-by-step instructions included with each of the four bun maker pieces. In addition to these four pieces, this product also includes 2 sets of 8 bobby pins -- 1 set is about 2&quot; long each and the other set is about 3&quot; long.<br />*I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.",positive,positive

"Warm Soothing Scent Kama Sutra Treasures of the Sea is an intriguing bath salt with a warm sensuous room enveloping fragrance. One scoop of the salts in a tub of water and you transform everyday bathing into bubbles and water the color of the ocean.<br /><br />The color reminded me of the turquoise waters near the Aiya Napa white caves in Cyprus. The texture of the water turns silky and you may notice your skin is more moisturized from the natural oils, especially the Wheat Germ Oil.<br /><br />While many may see the color as ""Azure"" there is a definite green vs. purple color mingling in the depths of blue and this does contain Algae. The texture of the salt is more like a sand than a salt and the shimmering finely ground blue salt crystals mingle with what looks like tiny pieces of broken marble. Of course, this all dissolves quickly and the bubbles last through the entire bath. In fact, the more you move around, the more bubbles appear.<br /><br />The warm scent soothes the soul and the color is dreamy and the bubbles look like clouds floating across an open sky. A shell of salts is all you need and a beautiful shell is included.<br /><br />I had so much fun taking a bath with these salts, that I ran my husband a bath too. These salts seem to inspire sharing and recently inspired a poem:<br /><br />Bubble Bath<br /><br />Turquoise mystery<br /><br />Opalescent bubbles<br /><br />Scent lingers in the air<br /><br />Water splashing over painted toes<br /><br />Sinking into the soothing warm<br /><br />Soul comfort misplaces cares<br /><br />Troubles dissolved<br /><br />Sinking down the drain<br /><br />The wisdom of silence<br /><br />Bliss of Escape<br /><br />Liquid remedy<br /><br />Immersion in solitude<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",positive,positive

"Quick, easy, blendable & at drugstore prices....gotta love it!! I think we all have days where we're looking for something quick and easy when it comes to makeup. Anything to get us out the door looking somewhat put together with the least amount of time involved is the goal. If you're looking for a quick eyeshadow look that takes next to no time these are one answer. Cream eyeshadow on one end and a brush on the other. The brush is surprisingly usable, but since I've got older eyes (which means older skin that needs to be babied) I just use one of mine. They go on pretty smooth and creamy. Not a ton of pigment on the first pass, but it's very buildable. The swatches on my arm are 2 passes of each color. They also blend out really well. I put a couple passes on my lower lid and blend it up into my crease and I'm good to go. There is a bit of shimmer in this one, but it's not overwhelming. Just a bit of sparkle that looks good even on aging eyes. They make it through the whole day, but I did notice some creasing and breakdown after about 6-8 hours. Not a lot, just enough to be noticeable. Overall these were pretty impressive and I think they'd also be great for someone who was just getting into makeup too.",positive,positive

"Hydrates well For Beloved Girl Extreme Moisture Mineral Cloud-Silk Facial Treatment Mask for Sensitive Skin, (25g x 1PC)-<br /><br />I actually liked this mask quite a bit. It’s not quite up to par with the other mask I’ve tried by this brand (the other was a completely different style of face mask though). This is a good sheet mask. It is rather thin however it didn’t rip at all when I applied it. It is a little tricky to put on though. It comes with a plastic frame to help guide it when applying. I still did have that issue where the mask rolled up a little in the corner when I peeled off the plastic frame. I had to try to unravel the sections that did this after it was on my face which eventually I was able to do.<br /><br />Pros-<br />Refreshing and hydrating.<br /><br />Does moisturizes very well. They put enough of the product in that I was able to apply the extra over areas the mask didn’t cover.<br /><br />My skin felt very soft after using this.<br /><br />Cons-<br />Difficult to apply evenly. It’s not too much worse than the average sheet mask though.<br /><br />I don’t like the full ingredients list isn’t available or at least not easy to find. I see they highlight the “key ingredients” but not the full list.<br /><br />Overall I do like this mask because the results were very good for me. My face felt cleansed and hydrated. I do think it’s a little on the pricey side for the type of mask it is but it’s not by much so I would reorder this. The ingredients not being fully transparent is something I wish they would change. The results were good for me though.",positive,neutral

"Flower very nice, but birdcage veil difficult to handle I purchased this for my upcoming wedding. The flower (called a ""fascinator"" in the bridal industry, I'm learning) is very nice, and I will definitely wear it. I may cut the wires with the bling off, but that's just me. I'm having a simple summer picnic wedding with a white, cotton halter dress, and the bling might be a bit too much. I am going to ask my best friend before making this decision. Either way, it's a nice piece.<br /><br />The birdcage veil, though, wasn't really how it's pictured. In the photo it seems to have a lot more conformity to a human head than the actual piece that showed up in my mailbox. The real thing starts out unruly, and popped up in weird places on my head. I tried calming the thing down with bobby pins, but it still looked unshapely. Finally, though, after watching the company's videos (they give you a piece of paper with a link to some instructional videos) and keeping it near the shower for a few days to get it to calm down, it did actually look good. I have a large head with puffy hair, and I found that if I put the comb towards the back of my head on the right, and allow the veil to come up over top my head from the back right, hanging down around my face, that the veil's large size is actually an asset, because it covers my puffy hair without flattening it.<br /><br />I was so worried about the veil that I ordered a separate, handmade birdcage veil from etsy for $30 (see it at pompandplumage.com) that I hoped would be more what I'm looking for. When it arrived, though, it was too small to wear without wearing my puffy hairstyle slicked back, which isn't how I plan to wear my hair. I actually went back to the cheaper veil I bought here on amazon.<br /><br />Whatever you end up doing with the veil portion, the flower/fascinator is nice enough, and cheap enough, that it's still worth the purchase. The flower/fascinators on the same site on etsy where I purchase the other birdcage veil, pompandplumage.com, are $60-$70, and look similar, so even without the veil, this was a good deal.",positive,positive

"Next level soap! I love these. I added a table spoon to 24 oz of oils and it is perfect. These are really fine, which i like better than the larger ones I've used in the past. The large ones are too aggressive. Large or small, jojoba beads will leave your skin feeling fantastic. They don't really do anything visually, for anyone who may try to use them for aesthetics. Add them around a thin-medium trace so they suspend properly. These have a fairly high melting point, so it shouldn't be an issue, but don't melt them.",positive,positive

Then did the Chat...no help. Said they would fw to a supervisor. They sent me a link to troubleshoot but the link didn't work. So I chatted again asking for the link. They said they would pass my request to a supervisor and they would reply in 1-2 days again. WHAT THE HECK? ZERO customer service. SO FRUSTRATED!,negative,negative

"Great toenail clippers (all four pairs) I used these toenail clippers immediately upon receiving them & I love them. I was worried about the size of the clippers because I wanted them to all be the size of toenail clippers & not little fingernail clippers. All four pairs are the size of toenail clippers. Like previous reviews said, it's easy to clip your skin. So, I advise you to start far back and slowly cut the toenails down until you get the hang of it. I did not cut my skin at all. Even with being a cautious new user, I still cut my toenails at a much quicker rate than I due with regular jaw toenail clippers. I plan to show this product to several friends and family members. I would purchase this product again, if I ever had a reason to.",positive,positive

Well that just gave me the go ahead to make some whipped shea butter lotion.

"Shiny finish, not invisible.Glare under lights is visible with fine hair. They work well, a much needed thing for fine hair and tape in extensions. The key is to use the tape in extension that has tape already, and rather than sandwiching too tape in extensions together (too heavy for fine hair) you use the single sided tape for the other side. I watched many videos on how to do this and I did it myself and they feel fine. There aren't very many pieces in this package for the price, however. It's a bit expensive for only 48 pieces. I nearly used all of them for one application.<br />Update: After a full month of having the extensions in. Over-all a good experience but will not order these tapes again.<br />I am changing my rating in follow up. Impossible to remove without damaging hair. The glue warmed and leaked out the sides over time and caught my hair in the leaked glue. This shortened the length of time I could wear the extensions. I tried to use this one sided tape and it is very shiny, you can see the glimmer of the tape. Not shine free. I would not use this on fine hair.",neutral,neutral

"As close as I have found to my original from the 1990's I've only had for a few weeks so can't speak to durability but these are the closest match to the size and type I was looking for. I took great lengths with this review since I had such a difficult time finding what I needed. Hope to spare someone else the grief. They are not micro which was too small, true to size 1cm wide and approximately 1.5 cm long.<br /> So far they are holding well (I have long thick hair with bangs). I had one left from a set bought probably 20 years ago which were obviously good quality. They are nearly identical except these do allow for a better grip for your fingers which has to be a feat for such a small clip. Plus I have arthritis in my thumbs, it makes a difference. These are of a different plastic maybe less durable but it's not that thin brittle type plastic. I'm adding pictures to compare. My original is on the left side. So yes I'm pleased with how these clips are designed and if they hold up for longer than 9 months that would be nice.",positive,positive

"Intense Hydration With winter approaching, it's time to start thinking about cold-weather skincare.

You do have to use soap and water to remove the powder well. The spoolie and brush tool come in handy for adding a bit of powder where you want it, fine tuning, and the spoolie is a good size for combing and bushing to a nice finish. I would love a taupe or blonde option for color because the brown is just not quite right. But, the shape and look of the brow is so good, I can tolerate the color. Also, maybe the darker color with blonde hair, is good!<br />This kit comes with a dark brown and light brown color, chestnut.

"Amazing facial oil Dr. Au Anti Aging Face Oil took me a little bit by surprise to be honest. This is a very nice retinol oil that has quickly become one of my favorites. It comes in a little dropper bottle. It has a very mild and very pleasant fragrance that I really like a lot. It lingers for a bit and I wish it would linger a lot longer than it does to be honest. I can’t figure out what it smells like but I really like the mix of it. This contains retinyl palmitate, related to retinol. Remember, whenever you use retinol you want to make sure to protect your skin from the sun since retinol makes your skin more sensitive to the sun. However retinol is very good for your skin.<br /><br />This face oil is very light and absorbs quickly into the skin. It does leave your skin slightly oily but to me that is ok since I am using a face oil. I prefer to use this at night for two reasons, one because my face is a bit oily for a while when using it and also because retinol containing products do make your skin more sensitive to the sun. When I use this product my skin feels always super soft and smooth and looks nicely moisturized. There are little specs in it that look like gold and I am not sure if it is that or something else but when I use this facial oil my skin has this natural glow to it that I really like. This oil is fantastic and is quickly becoming one of my go to facial oils.",positive,positive

"Good, but could be a lot better I bought 2 of these. One for myself and one for my Mom. My Mom liked it but I did not. I have always used wooden back brushes with natural bristles but decided to try a plastic one to see if it would last longer. I have never liked nylon bristles and sometimes they irritate my skin. The description said that the bristles on this brush were boar bristles.<br /><br />First problem I noticed was the handle was shorter than I was used to. I am a short average build guy and I have some difficulty reaching my entire back easily with it. Second issue, the bristles are some sort of soft plastic not boar as advertised. The bristles are tightly packed which is nice but very soft. They didn't irritate my skin like some but the softness left me questioning how clean my back was getting. The tightly packed bristles seem like a great feature but after you use it a couple of times you realize that it makes air tough to get through the bristles so the brush takes longer to dry than most. If you don't really sling the remaining water out of them and/or pat down with a cloth the brush may still be damp the next time you go to use it which doesn't seem hygienic. The last issue I have with this back brush is there are no grips or non-slip material where you hold it. It can become kind of slippery and cumbersome when the handle gets wet.<br /><br />This does seem to be a well made brush that should last a long time, it just wasn't for me. It is definitely better than the the plastic back brushes you find in most retail stores. My Mom loves it. She kept hers and I was easily able to get return authorization through Amazon with no issues for mine. Going back to a wooden natural bristle brush. Sometimes it's better to stick with what you know.",neutral,positive

"Finally, a worthwhile 2 in 1! I bought this in preparation for dying my hair blue for my 30th birthday. (Who wants to grow old if you have to grow up, amiright?) Using this beforehand, my hair felt soft, bouncy, and lustrous. At the appointment, the stylist talked me into getting some Paul Mitchell Color Protect shampoo and conditioner which was a total waste of money in my opinion and I have since abandoned it for this again. My hair isn't quite as nice as it was before all the processing I did, but I expected that. This shampoo however has outperformed the Paul Mitchell stuff by far in terms of protecting my color from wash-out/fade-out, making my hair feel touchably soft, and not weighing it down. My hair does start to look a little more oily on day 2 than it did before using this, but it's a minor difference, and nothing a little dry shampoo can't fix.",positive,positive

"Puts A Layer Of Silky Smoothness Between You & Your Make-Up N3 No Name Necessary Pore-Minimizing Mattifying Oil and Shine Control Anti-aging Makeup Face Primer Spray (200ml) puts a layer of silky smoothness between your skin and your make-up. I have combination skin- some parts dry, regular and oily. I also have aging skin, so I really didn’t think this primer spray would help me, but it surprisingly did. This comes in a spray bottle and you have to shake the bottle well before spraying, keeping your eyes tightly shut.<br /><br />It sprays with a fine mist, but has a foaming in it. After spraying, I gently rubbed it more evenly on my face. It dries instantly and wow, my face felt like velvet. If anyone knows about aging skin- your make-up shows the fine lines and wrinkles more exaggerated. This primer spray somehow smooths your skin more, leaving it like a smooth slate for make-up. I am very impressed with this spray, as nothing helps aging skin like this does for make-up, powder, even touch up concealers. A wonderful product. 5 STARS.",positive,positive

"Get a spa quality treatment in 20 minutes. I love to pamper myself with deep hydrating/anti-aging facial masks. After all, why do I need to spend a fortune on spa treatments when I can have that spa experience in the comfort and privacy of my own home. I received this particular mask at a special price for the purposes of product testing and reviewing. Everything contained in this review is my own personal experience using this mask.<br />First I made sure my face was freshly washed and found a quiet area where I could apply the mask and lay back and relax for 20 minutes. By quiet area, I mean I made sure I was home alone so no one would bother me, I turned the television off and played some soft soothing music to relax myself and to really give myself that spa experience.<br />Applying the mask was super simple and it completely fit all the contours of my face evenly. Thereby giving my face all the wonderful benefits of this rich hydrating formula. Then I just relaxed and let the mask do all the work. I have sensitive skin and was pleased that the all natural ingredients in this mask did not irritate my sensitive skin what so ever. In fact, it actually helped improve the look and feel of my skin after just one use. After the 20 minutes were up, I was amazed at how soft and hydrated my skin felt. I had no idea I had let my skin get that dry. I plan on taking time out for myself at least once a week to give myself a deep hydrating, anti-aging mask. After all, the key to younger looking skin, is keeping it well hydrated. I love these masks and would also recommend them. They make you feel great afterward!",positive,positive

"Great oil for massages and salt scrubs I purchased this apricot oil specifically to use for salt scrubs I make with essential oils for use on hands or during a shower or bath. Apricot oil is one of my favorites to use in them because it isn't super thick and greasy and leaves just the right amount of moisture after you dry yourself off after using it in a scrub. Additionally, it also makes a great massage oil. Not a lot of fragrance to it and it works in nice without you having to wash your hands after use. Love it!",positive,positive
Thick & Creamy A good hand cream is essential. This one is excellent. It is thick and creamy. It's very moisturizing and is packed with skin-loving botanicals. It's fragrance-free in case you have allergies or just prefer the unscented option. This is a high-quality hand cream that's great to keep in your bag.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.,positive,positive

"Mine had defects First, the good: hair is soft, silky and only a tiny bit too shiny. It has good style and only shed a small amount on removing from package and brushing. Not too much hair, but not thin or flimsy. Has two combs at the top in front to secure wig, and the adjustable latches at the neck. I was prepared to love it forever and buy ten more. However:<br />The not so good and the bad: the color is flat black, there is no natural color variation and looks like a poor dye job, the ear tabs did not align with my actual ears, and so poked out to the sides a bit. The hair line would not lay flat to my head, and when I tried to pull some of the front strands to the side to keep them out of my eyes, I saw that the seams are thick and obvious. Since it has a bit of lace at the top I figured to reset the part, but there is a seam in the middle of the lace, so parting it<br />in any other location within the lace area literally shows a fat black seam.<br /><br />Now, I am not a wig expert. I don't know how to make a mediocre wig great, and to this wig's credit, it is better than mediocre. So if you happen to be one of those people with such knowledge, this is a fabulous wig to mess with and work your magic on. And perhaps my particular wig is a defect that slipped through, but regardless, it is a disappointment to me. I would return it, but I made the mistake of cutting the lace right away (like I said, I was excited about how great the wig looked lol). Perhaps down the road I will find a magic maker who can make my wig work for me, so it's not a total loss. Just disappointing.",negative,positive

"I recommend washing it after receiving with a deep conditioner and ... I'm not sure if it really has real hair in it but it works well. Only complaint is that it's difficult to make straight parts with it. I recommend washing it after receiving with a deep conditioner and de-tangler. It made the hair on mine a lot easier to work with. Warning: at first a lot of hair falls out, but that's normal and to be expected. Especially for this kind of deal. After the initial washing/brushing it will only fall out a tiny bit, like a normal humans hair.",positive,positive
"Retired hairdresser Because of my training I have some knowledge of skin care and this is the best antioxidant treatment serum I have found. It leaves my soon-to-be-50 skin looking great. The ingrdients are exactly the same and in the same amounts as the other spa product but this one costs less than half! It is a light weight, fast asorbing serum with no fragrence to irritate sensitive skin. I use it before applying the hydrating gel. Can be used alone or worn under make up. Make-up application simply glides on almost like using a primer. I use this (along with the hydrating gel) twice a day, in the morning after my shower while my pores are still open and before bed after washing my face with a gentle non-soap cleanser. The only additional product I need is a good facial moisturizer with sunscreen under my make-up. Do yourself a favor and try this if you are looking for a great anti aging skin care treatment to reverse old damage AND to prevent new damage.",positive,positive

"Doesn't last too long This product was easy to apply and did have good results. I used them on my brows because I am so fed up with paying for it to be done poorly at the salons! The only bad part was this only lasted maybe 4 days, and I only showered 2 of those days :( I wish it would last longer, but honestly when I get them done at the salon it's probably about the same length for me. I naturally have black hair (very thin hairs on my brows where they look barely there) but have it highlighted and got this in Dark Brown and it was perfect. Even though it doesn't last too long, you get a lot more for your money compared to getting them done at the salon.<br />Another plus is that you only need to leave this on for 2-3 mins. When I go to the salon, they seem to leave it on longer, so I do like not needing to have this sit on my skin for a long time and still yield the same results. I don't think letting this sit longer would make it last any longer.",neutral,neutral

"Allowed me to stop using styling products I have fine hair and I've always had trouble with it getting frizzy and poofy. In the past I've used a variety of pomades, water wax, etc., to tame and weigh down my hair. But after switching to Wen I don't need to use anything. My hair is soft, not frizzy, and easy to control. Since I don't need to add any products it feels and looks better. The Tea Tree blend worked better on soothing my dry scalp than the Cucumber Aloe that I originally tried (got it as a gift).<br /><br />It's definitely worth the price, but I would give it 5 stars if it were a little more affordable. The gallon size helps make it more economical.",positive,positive
"Feels amazing but pricey FOR BELOVED ONE Melasleep Brightening Lumi's key Bio-Cellulose Facial Treatment Mask (33g x 1PC)<br /><br />This is an impressive gel face mask. I love the feeling of this mask. It’s a heavy gel mask that is anything but dry. It’s extremely refreshing.<br /><br />I will say the directions are brief. When you take it out it’s tri-folded (the one image above are the two outer layers and the mask was in between those). It does rip if you aren’t cautious with it. There are 3 layers. Once you gently unfold it you peel off the first layer. Then apply to the face and after doing so peel off the outside cover. It is much easier if you pull out the eye holes and mouth hole before placing on your face. It does have a fair amount of staying power once it’s in place for a minute. Directions state to leave it on for 10-15 minutes. I left mine on for probably about 20 minutes.<br /><br />The end result was great. My skin felt clean, rejuvenated, and soft. I really am impressed with the results given my hesitation to try a brand I wasn’t familiar with. I wish I had more of these because I would love to use them on a regular basis but the cost is a bit unrealistic to me.<br /><br />Thus the one negative with this mask. The price point is very steep. I’ve had many masks that worked very well for much less. Now I did have a particularly great result from this mask so don’t get me wrong it may very well be worth the money to some. I’m just not one of those people that could justify it to myself. However, I do love the feeling I have after using it. I am not going to knock the product rating for the price point because that is really the only thing that I don’t like here. The product itself is really good and I’m happy with the results. I would just reiterate that the listing is for a single mask.",positive,positive

"Good basic oils, many uses You get 2 massive bottles of oil, one with sweet almond oil and the other with coconut oil. For each bottle they supply you with a pump dispenser which is great. It makes it so much easier to dispense the oil without making a mess to be honest. Both oils are claimed to be organic which is nice. This will run you $25 which in my eyes is a good deal.<br /><br />These oils can be used direct for skin care and as carrier oils, meaning you can add some essential oils to them to make your own custom oil blends. The oils themselves were pretty much fragrance-free which was a bit disappointing to me, but makes sense since these are often used as carrier oils. When you use this they are pretty lightweight and absorb quickly. I found they do leave the skin a bit greasy, but that is not a surprise since these are oils. That feeling does go away within about 15 minutes or so, so not too bad. All in all a good deal",positive,positive

"Fantastic for a blended tight/loose curl look Definitely works. Will curl my hair like no other tool I've tried. Long as in REALLY long wand which is awesome for us long haired women. BUT the advertising that you can have either tighter or looser curls by using selective sections of the wand - not so much. Unless you have some serious time to spend carefully wrapping then moving each little piece back to the larger knobs your hair ends up in the valleys, giving a tighter curl, which I don't always want.<br /><br />So for a breeze through my hair to get fabulous curls yes it's awesome.

"Comprehensive review of robusta coffee scrub I recently used this scrub and felt inspired to write a review about it for those that aren't sure if they should get this scrub or not.<br /><br />Before buying this scrub, I was aware coffee scrubs have been trending for a year or so. As others, I was very skeptical about it and wasn't sure how I felt about this beauty trend. The only way I was going to find out was to give it a try.<br /><br />Here's what I learned after using it that I think will help others should you decide to try it:<br /><br />1) Prepare your environment and set aside time before using it - Prior to using the scrub, decide where you are going to use it (shower, bath, fenced backyard, etc.) because I'm warning you now, it's gonna get messy. I have a regular sized shower/bath, so if I plan on using this again, I would get myself completely wet, sit in the tub, use the scrub all over my body, rinse off (still sitting), then finally stand up to complete washing off. If you have a private fenced off backyard where you are near a hose, that's a good setting too. The whole process took approximately 40-50 minutes (I like to take my time). I used the whole pack because I literally used it all over my body, but you can use whatever amount you want. Just know that you will need time to really work it into your skin and let it set for a few minutes before washing it off.<br /><br />2) Be honest with yourself about your skin regimen - What I mean is, if you are not disciplined about your skin regimen or don't want to take time to use this scrub, then honestly I don't know this product is going to work for you. Personally, I'm committed to a regular and consistent skin regimen and set aside time to use this product to get optimal results. I am just saying this isn't like a typical scrub and takes more time to work it in to your skin.<br /><br />3) You'll likely need soap to get the rest of it off - Even after a rinse, it will stain, just like coffee will do, so I used some shea butter body wash and a body brush to get the rest of it off. Once I was completely clean, I dried off and used body shop cocoa butter all over my body (it's what I usually use anyway).<br /><br />4) For people with very oily skin be aware - Since this product has coconut oil and you are highly prone to breaking out, I'm not sure if this is a good idea; the amount of coconut oil is definitely noticeable so just be aware.<br /><br />The verdict: I will say, this made me feel amazing afterwards. My skin felt very smooth and soft. That being said, I bought it without having any expectations. I tried it mainly out of curiosity. As there are advances in beauty products, I am naturally going to want to try new things. I have heard that coffee scrubs reduce cellulite or supports regeneration of new skin cells. Honestly I don't know if that's true and frankly find that doubtful. However, I can say it is better than most scrubs I've used in the past, and it's a wonderful treat for the skin from time to time. I would buy and use it again for occasional use.",positive,positive

"works well, but has a minor design flaw I have used ionizing brushes for over 30 years—since they were first sold by Sharper Image. The negative ions work very well to flatten the surface of the cuticle of each hair, making the hair less likely to break or split, and also softer.<br /><br />This particular brush works well, but the one I received has a minor design flaw: the brush part pops off so easily that I have to hold it tight with my thumb, making it less ergonomic than it might be... not an issue for me. As for the vibrating part, I couldn't tell, but that's not what I bought it for. This brush generates NO heat, which is exactly what I wanted. Unlike some similar products, there are NO seams that could catch the hair.<br /><br />TIPS FOR ALL IONIZING BRUSHES:<br />(1) if they don't need electricity (cord or batteries), they're not the real deal<br />(2) heating elements, just like heated blow-drying, tend to dry out your hair and make it more brittle: even oily hair can get dried out<br />(3) brush your hair SLOWLY to get the best result<br />(4) if your hair is flatter after using it, and you don't like that, bend over and brush it upside down to get more volume",positive,positive
"Nice moisturizing sheet mask that smells nice This is an pretty nice face sheet mask in my opinion. In the pack you get 4 masks for about $15, so almost $4 per mask, not the cheapest but also not the most expensive I have used to date.<br /><br />The masks are very easy to use. They come individually wrapped and are folded nicely. The material of these is not the softest I have used but they work. They smell REALLY nice however, a nice gentle floral with some other tones mixed in, very nice. You use these for about 15 to 20 minutes or so and gently rub the remainder of the mask into your skin.<br /><br />When I was done my skin felt pretty soft over. This mask is nice but it is not my favorite. My skin also had a nice residual scent left from the mask which I did enjoy. I would have expected a little better for the price since I have used cheaper masks that were nicer. All in all these are pretty nice though.",positive,positive

"Can't do without I received these gratis in exchange for an impartial review. Hadn't heard of them before. What a great idea- one of those products you don't know how you ever did without. I hate to admit it but I'm old enough to have used Maybelline mascara when it came in a little red box- you moistened a brush (looked like a little hairbrush), stroked it across the dry mascara, making a paste, and applied it. It took a lot of work. Everyone I knew kept an extra dry brush for thinning clumps and distributing the mascara evenly. Later, I kept an old empty mascara tube/brush for brushing lashes and evening out mascara applications. These work SO much better! Lashes are much longer and not clumpy with these wonderful brushes. Also great for using after applying false eyelashes for blending/interspersing the false lashes with your own. I gave some to my niece and my aunt to try, they like them as much as I. The magenta color is nice too. Fantastic!",positive,positive

"For Facial Use Only! First off, you shouldn't be shaving anything but your face with this razor. Norelco's older models seem to be heavier and have more powerful motors; this thing is more like those old electric lawnmowers that couldn't cut grass more than 1/2"" high. It gives a middling shave on face and neck, but it certainly can't handle the forest around the Great Oak Tree, if you know what I mean. It also won't do armpits or backs or legs very well.<br /><br />I'd go with an older model that is heavier and seems to have a more powerful motor.

"New Shaver - Quality? This is the third Norelco rotary electric shaver I've owned in, say the past 25-30 years. My observations are: 1) it is the only Norelco rotary shaver I've ever owned that occaisionally ""pulls"" a whisker (Ouch) rather than cut it off. The motor sounds ""weaker"" with fewer RPM's than previously-owned Norelco razors and that may be the problem. 2) the routine shave is OK. 3)the small icon indicating the razor needs cleaning lights up after every shave so it's essentially useless. 3) the battery life after a charge is spectacular. I get a month or more on a re-charge. 4) Assembly and overall quality seems very good. Finally, I wish Norelco had not cut corners on the power of the electric motor especially on a shaver costing as much as this one does.",positive,positive

Although it is a quality shea butter, the way it has been processed left the butter very grainy and not as creamy as I was expecting. It is a thick, heavy butter that is solid at room temperature and has a lot of use for hair and body purposes. It is sourced from an area in Africa that doesn't produce a real rancid smelling butter. It smells distinctly like shea but not like the shea sourced from more eastern countries. The butter when applied to the skin feels thick and heavey but that isn't a problem for me. I would need to indirectly melt and re-solidify this butter in order to smooth it out and kill the grainy texture it comes with. I'd also whip this butter to make it creamy.<br /><br />Price: Reasonable<br />Texture: Grainy but not too smooth, sort of like peanut butter but thicker<br />Color: Ivory, more of an off white, cream like tone<br />Scent: Hard to describe but it's distinctly Shea which never smells pleasing<br /><br />Overall, this company's shea butter is a good quality butter, high quality for some but for me good/decent due to the fact it's grainy and doesn't have the smooth texture I'm used too. The color is normal and the butter feels thick, heavy and heavenly on thick dry skin like eczema. I'd recommend this company's shea butter and possibly repurchase in the future.<br /><br />•This quality shea butter was purchased for a promotional price in exchange for my unbiased and honest review.",positive,positive

Great Who wouldn't want to play in magical rainbow hair? This would be a great fun learning tool for young people to practice hair. The hair was great quality. There wasn't much shedding.

"Like this shampoo! I really enjoyed this shampoo and have felt as though it has made my hair softer and healthier. It has definitely made a different in my routine!

"Rough reaction It's kind of funny, I don't have that much gray in my beard but there's some and no one has ever said anything about it looking bad. The few that comment say it looks nice since my beard has blacks, several shades of dark brown but it annoys me! The Grizzly natural beard color works pretty good for me but I was wanting something to completely wipe out the gray hair. I tried this Godefroy Tint Kit and was very disappointed with it. After testing it and finding the right mixture (wife helped), I applied it to 4 areas that have graying. Both cheeks have a little strip of gray and at the top of my sideburns where they connect with my hair (I'm bald so taking a guess). I left it on for the directed time, started washing it off and one sideburn started burning. It wasn't a terrible burn but it was bad enough to speed me up. When I got out of the shower, I had a red mark about 2 inches long right beside the top of my sideburn. I put some aloe on it and went to bed. The next morning, I got up and the red spot was peeling like it was sunburn! It had burnt me to some extent. What color did go on wasn't that good. Maybe I should have used black. I might try it again in the future and try to be more careful about letting it get on unprotected, no hair, areas of my skin but for now, I would only recommend it if you're comfortable in your ability to keep it on the hair.",neutral,negative

Didn't work for me-updated Starting feb 2013' I took one a day for 30 days and didn't note any improvement in my growth. I've upped it to two a day and so far not having adverse effects from doing so. Will update in another 60 days.<br /><br />Update may 2013<br /><br />I don't think this is working for me. My hair is still thinning and breakage is still a problem. I only take 1 a day now as 2 a day brought no results. I have 2 months left before I decide to end this 6 month trial. So far it's not looking good.<br /><br />June 2013- I can honestly say that my hair has not gotten better since I started these back in February. It actually looks worse than it did when I started these 5 months ago. I'm done waiting for the supplement to kick in.,negative,positive

"Big Bar Of Soap! I have been using this soap for the last 5 days and wanted to use it that long to see if it works for me. I have sensitive skin on my face that is prone to breakouts no matter how much the company says it is for sensitive skin. I have minor adult acne and still hate it. I just want clear skin...is that not too much to ask? Well, after just 5 days, I see a major improvement around my t-zone and chin area that normally breaks out with everything new I try. I did have one bump that showed up and drew a white head but only lasted a day at the most before it dried up. This is my first time ever using an African black soap and always heard good things about it, and so happy I tried it. This is a really BIG bar of soap that I've cut into smaller pieces so that it last longer. I use it on my arms, legs, and face only. So far, doing wonders. I no longer have dried out skin to where I have to immediately put on lotion after showering. Totally worth trying out, even just once!<br /><br />I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.",positive,positive

"Gorgeous and comfortable butterfly hair clips. My daughter and I cannot get over how pretty these butterfly hair clips are. My daughter loves to wear all 12 in her hair, at the same time. The clips are soft, like the kind designed for babies and toddlers, so they are not sharp and pokey. They are easy to clip on and take out. They are lightweight and feel comfortable enough to wear all day long. I remove them from my daughter’s hair at bedtime so they don’t get crushed. The butterflies have a simple design. Their bodies and antennas are made from a thick material that has glitter built into it so it never sheds. The wings are made of fabric. Each and every butterfly clip in this set is well made and durable enough to wear frequently. We have gotten many compliments on these hair clips. They work well for teens and adults too.

You can wear them in the shower or to wash your face without getting your hair wet as well .

"Recommended I've been very happy with this brush. My hair has always been thin, but since it has started getting more gray, it has become more dry & coarse. I've been using a flat iron to smooth it out and get rid of the kinky nature. This has worked great for me instead. I wash it, dry it, and then just brush. One word of caution, the nubs are very hot, so you can put your hand over them, also, your hair will be warm for a few seconds after you brush thru it. I discovered I could use a dry wash cloth or heat resistant glove to assist in keeping my hair against the warming surface. As I place the brush under my hair & brush downward, I place my other hand (protected by cloth or glove) over the nubs, thereby holding the hair tight against the surface. The smoothing effect is great without any burning of the hair like with a straight iron. We also used it on my mixed race granddaughter whose hair is much thicker and kinkier. It took a little longer than it did on me, but it did smooth her hair faster than with a hot iron.",positive,positive

Impossible to apply without bruising your armpits ! I have been using Primal pit paste ( the jar version )for couple of months now and i was very happy with it.

Who could design such a thing? the catches the rollers mounted in are not much better as they stand, sharp and hard, into your feet.

"As advertised Not sure why other reviewers thought this came with clips and pins. It is advertised as just the bun makers. All things considered, I thought these were a great value for the price.

Usually I cut the extra layers out of the cotton ones, but it is still too hot and makes me feel like I'm smothering. These are great. Highly recommend.",positive,positive
"Very cute! They are perfectly sized for my 2 year old. They stay in and work great with her super silky fine hair. I love the assortment in the bundle and they seem to be good quality.

It dries within just a few minutes. It's a great help in keeping my legs happy when shaving daily during the summer, and the scent is summery too!<br /><br />I like their lip balm a bit, but it's the body lotion and shaving cream that I can't get through summer without.

"Great Face Setting! Elizabeth Mott $et for Life Loose Setting Powder is the 1st type of powder that has kept my oily skin under control all day long. It’s a light powder that comes out of the container through little holes so I have control over how much powder I want in the top of the container where I pick up the powder with my makeup brush. The design is wonderful. It’s sheer & applies nicely with my discretion. It’s the last product I put on my face in the morning. I don’t wear foundation or any of that. After cleansing I use toner (not everyday) then my moisturizer with sunscreen & primer. Finally I’m complete this great face setting powder. I’ve never found anything that keeps my face in place before I found this. Hours later no oil can be seen on my face~and my skin is oily! Late afternoon I may use the face blotting tissues to set my face more, depending on where/what I’m doing. Even then little oil shows through. In the past I’ve used a matte powder which worked but not as good as this. My skin color would be considered beige in the matte powder so I was hesitant on this “Translucent” color but it blends in wonderfully. I don’t look too pale or too dark. I love it! This is my 2nd purchase & my 1st lasted a long time. So I’m set for life & I highly recommend it if you have oily skin.",positive,positive

"Life changer Update: The company emailed me back fairly quickly and comped a replacement unit. No hassle! Can't wait to get it. It's getting harder and harder to resist the call of the dreaded razor.<br /><br />I purchased this product several months ago and have used the epilator and callus sander attachments. The sander works the same as any other battery powered shaver. The epilator is a life changer though. The first time you use it is a bit rough if you haven't used one before, or get waxed. But I haven't had to pick up a razor since I started using this. Each time is easier, and the hairs grow back soft rather than the nasty stubble you get from shaving. Also, I've noticed less and less hair growing back. I could probably pluck the individual hairs on my legs if I had to.<br />Be warned though that the ingrown hair issue is real. If you do not exfoliate you will regret it. As to the battery life issue, when I first started using this I would be able to only do one whole leg before the battery started winding down. I could maybe get through both armpits and forearms on a single charge. But now there's so little hair that I can do everything on one charge (both legs from foot to groin, armpits and forearms).<br />With all this said, the device stopped working today. It will charge, and the light turns on, but it won't spin. I have a feeling I'm going to need a new battery. Will update when I know more.",positive,positive

"Moisturizes as promised and mattifies beautifully I have used a few products by Follain to this date so I was curious to see how this mattifying moisturizer would perform. It comes in a little pump dispenser. It is on the more inexpensive side of the spectrum. The design is in line with the rest of the product line. The moisturizer is pretty much fragrance free, it maybe has a hint of a fragrance that is pleasant but very subtle.<br /><br />The moisturizer itself is very lightweight. It absorbs very quickly into the skin and leaves no residue behind. You can instantly notice the difference between where you put it and where you didn’t. It mattifies the skin nicely and really neutralizes the oils in your skin nicely. I was rather impressed by that to be honest. My skin looked great, nice and matte but still moisturized. It felt smooth to the touch but looked good. All in all I was pretty impressed and liked how my face felt and looked when I use this moisturizer.",positive,positive

Handy to have... This does the job of holding my hair dryer and curling brush. We had to modify it for the curling brush. We cut a circular piece of wood and hammered it into the bottom of the second largest tube. That way the curling brush wouldn't fall through. It's perfect now. I keep a brush in the small tube.

Nice but thin The hair is a very nice quality and it is the length expected but it is so thin and the tracks are so bulky. I'm so bummed they're so thin because my hair is so thick. They are all 3 individually wrapped bundles and tell you the length on them. The track part is super thick but the very ends just thin out sooo much. I guess that is how natural hair is so I will give it a try. I'm going to do a hand tied weft and will update after I wear them and let you guys know how they dry too. I have naturally curly hair so I always prefer hair that dried kinda wavy like my own and nobody ever says in the reviews that and I'm sure other people wanted to know too!,neutral,positive

"Nice starter kit Review for: Gel Nail Polish Kit With U V LED Light Nail Kit With 150W Nail Lamp 10 Colors Soak Off Gel Polish Nail Art Salon & Starter Kit With Rhinestones Glitters Manicure Tool Kit<br /><br />This is a great starter kit for anyone new to doing their own gel nails. It includes a full sized LED light, something not all kits do. You get a lot of smaller tools and accessories in this kit and you also get 10 colors of polish as well as well as a top coat and base.<br /><br />The polish itself has a nice consistency and the handles of the brushes are easy to use. They come with the colored dots on tops of the handles. I did remove one star from my review because two of the bottles of polish did not have their lids on tight and my kit arrived with two leaking polish bottles and a mess to clean up. This is a QA issue, not a packing issue as everything was packed with care.",positive,positive

"Awesome Kit of Generously-Sized Minis! This travel set of products is a complete winner for me, and the sizes are generous for minis. I love the vials of the Priming Water and the Prime Essence. I actually prefer these two items more than the tube of primer itself, although it is good too. The two liquid products go on so thin and seamlessly, that it’s the perfect amount of primer to smooth everything out and help the foundation last. Sometimes full-on primers can be a bit too smoothing and it makes me feel like my makeup is going to slide off. Everything is very mildly scented (a mix of fresh & floral), but not overwhelming and the scent doesn’t stick around. The No Pore-Blem primer is nice and works well to smooth out specific zones on my face, but I don't use it all the time. For all over coverage, I prefer the Priming Water, followed by the Prime Essence, which makes my skin look and feel great, and helps my foundation look awesome.",positive,positive

My hairdresser confirmed that overuse<br />will build up the oil from the Argan Oil Shampoo and Conditioner. I have decided to use<br />it occasionally instead of every time I wash my hair.

"Beautiful and worked great for my wedding These hair pieces are beautiful and worked great for my wedding.

The clip stayed in my hair the entire day and did not move even with lots of dancing! I would recommend this set to others.",positive,positive
Leaves skin slightly sticky. Made in China. I am noticing many beauty products are now made in China but they really try to hide that fact. This left my skin sticky feeling then within a few minutes it started to itch. Had to wash it off quickly. A fine rash did develop after 10 min. The rash was gone next morning so I must be allergic to part of it. Not sure what it is in it to cause this. The Vit C is rather far down the list.,neutral,positive

I DO use an exfoliator in conjunction with this wax to prevent ingrown hairs but I'm happy with the fragrance and am excited to try their others. After 6 weeks I noticed my leg hair decreased in size and stiffness so that's a huge plus. Awesome company. Awesome product.,positive,positive

"Great cloth for removing makeup. Equal to the Makeup Eraser I love the idea of these makeup removing rags. It saves a lot of money to be able to buy one product that removes makeup, oil, and dirt without having to buy makeup wipes, cleanser, and all the other products that we spend money on to clean makeup off of our faces.<br />I will be comparing this product to the name brand Makeup Eraser http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KBPSUYC?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00 that I bought off Amazon as well and have had since June 16th 2015 so I can see if they are the same of different.<br /><br />Makeup Eraser Claims:<br /><br /> Makeup Eraser removes 100% of your makeup with just water.<br /> Removes mascara including waterproof mascara in just seconds.<br /> Cloth is approximately 7&#34; wide x 16&#34; long.<br /> All natural, no chemicals, and machine washable.<br /> Use up to 1000 times and everything comes clean;no stains and remains soft. Promotes healthy skin.<br /><br />Makeup Remover Claims:<br /><br /> Reusable. Simply clean it in the wash for a brand new cloth, again and again.<br /> Absolutely NO harsh chemicals on your face<br /> Super soft material that is gentle on the skin<br /> Clears away hard to remove makeup with less effort<br /><br />Makeup Remover (purple) Pros and cons Vs. The Makeup Eraser (pink)<br />* Both cloths are soft and both sides feel the same as the other.<br />*The purple cloth is a tad bigger than the pink cloth which is nice.<br />* They both remove waterproof mascara easily along with other regular makeup.<br />* They both wash up the same.<br />* The makeup eraser feels thicker than the Makeup Remover but does not affect the makeup removers ability to remove makeup.<br />*The price is quite different. The Makeup Remover (purple) is around $13.00 and the Makeup Eraser is around $20.00 for pretty much the exact same thing.<br /><br />If you are looking for a way to save money and want a cheaper version than the Makeup Eraser but performs the exact same, I would go with the Makeup remover. Save that extra money because this cloth performs the same thing as the Makeup Eraser.<br /><br />* I was sent the makeup remover cloth at a discounted price for my ubiased review. I bought the Makeup Eraser at full price. All opinions and comparisons are my own.",positive,positive

An additional plus is the shape of the product, it is shaped to fit the underarm perfectly. Amazing product!",positive,positive
"Well Made Unit This is an extremely well-made unit and appears completely waterproof. It charges in about an hour with a charge that lasts me four showers. While it removes some skin I would prefer stiffer rubber “bristles.” The handle is made of a slippery plastic that is impossible to hang into with soapy hands. Probably OK for the bathtub, but risky in the shower. Men usually have larger backs and are less flexible. So I made a longer “handle” with a 12” PVC pipe, attached with a gasket and a hose clamp, easily removed for charging. The pipe also doesn’t slip in a soapy hand. With all the running gear in the head the unit is top heavy when in the charger. Even the suction cups on the charger base can’t hold it upright. However, the gasket for the handle also pushes the unit enough off center to balance it and prevent fall overs. The instruction sheet is a riot. It reads like it was run from Chinese through a translation program into “English.” The best line is “Especially designed with horny brush and thus removing residual horniness.” If only it were so simple! It should be rewritten by a native English speaker.",positive,positive

It will definitely catch knots in long fine hair. I love the look of it tho. I did purchase another I think I'd actually better comb. It has lines in it like it could be real horn. This has nothing except beauty I think. If you know how to tell, please tell me.<br />4/9/19 this comb did crack . Sooo I actually prefer the other comb I bought here. It's horn solid black.

"Like just name it I have tried SO MANY facial blotting papers. Like just name it, I've tried it.. from Sephora, Ulta, Ebay, Amazon.. just believe me. These are the best!<br /><br />Other blotting tissues are just that, super thin barely tissues that barely soak up oil before the papers turn translucent. So you end up using like 5 sheets for your whole face, and even then I don't feel clean. With these, the sheets are thick and coated, but it's not powdery. You press the light colored end on your face and it soaks up the oil and turns the area black! And it really does soak up oil, but leaves makeup intact. I use only one sheet for my whole face to feel clean, and a second sheet if I'm in a humid area. Then a facial mist. It's definitely the best blotting sheets you can find out there!",positive,positive

I give it a slight edge over my old one because the rose quartz is pretty. I'm not sure if it is anti-aging because I don't really pay attention to that. If it is having an effect, then great, but for me, the rolling action helps me wind down at the end of the day. The motions are soothing and quartz is cool against the skin. It is easy to clean and it keeps well too. With the two roller bottles, it does make a nice gift set. But this is a set that I'm keeping. Hopefully this one doesn't disappear.",positive,positive

"Pretty good My hair is soft, moisturized and bouncy. No weight from products to try to add this after washing.

"Great concept! Throw away your old tweezers, and bring in this guy. These are time savers! Instead of plucking each individual hair just spring for this baby. It plucks at hair the same way, but cuts the time dramaticly. When I say the same I mean the same too. So don't expect it to be pain free cause its not. The entire thing is practically a giant spring. It closes on your hair, and when you twist it. It pulls away all the hair it catches.<br /><br />Conclusion: it's not the most comfortable, but it works. It hurts, but only for a little, and in my opinion it's way better then taking off each individual hair off. And the little blade is basically for a closer, or better finish.<br /><br />And if you found this useful in anyway hit that helpful button for me. Have a great day !",positive,positive
