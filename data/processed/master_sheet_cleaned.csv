But when it comes to helping with severe rashes, itching and pain- make sure you refrigerate this first before applying, because you will be happy you did. Applying this cold is the best relief ever- the pain goes away immediately. Take the time to refrigerate the jar for maximum, instant relief! 5 STARS.",1466,240

"So Much Better Than 5 Magnet Eyelashes After Trying Several Of The 5 Magnet Type, I Found These And I'M So Glad I Did!

It's not the best hold but I can use it for some relax days.,482,97

"Works Great And Is Chemical Free. I Bought This Makeup Remover Because I Wanted Something Different Than The Disposable Wipes That I Was Using.  I Like That This Towel Is Chemical Free And Much Cheaper Than Continuing To By Packages Of Wipes. I Have Seen A Similar Product On Sale In Stores For A Lot More Money So I Decided To Try This One. It'S Very Soft. I Love The Way It Feels Against My Skin. I Really Like That I Can Use It And Then Hang It Up To Dry And Reuse It For About A Week Before I Toss It In The Washing Machine. After It Dries, It Is Still Soft Unlike A Regular Washcloth That Gets Hard And Stiff. It Does Get Makeup Marks On It, Especially From My Mascara, But They Come Out In The Wash.  I Was Curious As To Whether The Towel Actually Took Off All Of My Makeup When Compared To A Prepackaged Wipe So I Used A Wipe After I Used This Makeup Remover. There Was Very Little Makeup On The Wipe. I Was Very Pleasantly Surprised. I Also Like That The Makeup Remover Is Rectangular Instead Of The Small Square Shape That Some Of The Similar Products Are.

"Needs Better Instructions - Doesn'T Have Self Timer! But Does Clean Well I'Ve Been Using My Clarisonic On And Off For The Past Few Years And It'S A Pain To Purchase The Replacement Brushes For That. It Also Kind Of Grosses Me Out That The Bacteria Can Live In Those Bristles..The Ones That Are Supposed To Deep Clean You Face! I'Ve Been Wanting To Try The Foreo Luna For A While But That Costs $200!  This Item Looks Almost Identical To That Luna Cleansing Brush. My Friend Uses Her Luna And Swears By It Now. I Compared Hers To This One And I Think The Shape Of This Facial Brush Is A Lot More Practical Since It Comes To That Point At The Top Which Is Great Around The Eye, Nose, Mouth Areas. However, Looking At The Luna Bristles And The Bristles On This Unit You Can Tell The Luna Has Their Bristles Closer And Also Has A Great Variety Of  Brush Levels Which Their Claim Is To More Efficiently Cleanse The Skin Meeting The Specific Needs Of Different Facial Areas... Compared To The Sytles Ii, This Unit Only Has 2 Types Of Bristles.  The Luna Says It Cleanses With 8,000 Pulsations Per Minute, But This Unit Says It Can &#34;Reach 32,000 Times Per Minute Massage Design If High Frequency Vibration&#34; ...Which I'M Not Sure How True That Is..And What That Even Means.... What Is 32,000 Times? What Is It Referring To?...This Leads Me To My Other Gripe With This Product...........The Instructions!!!!!!!!<Br /><Br />I Wish This Unit Had Better Instructions...I Was Reading It And I'M So Confused - It Doesn'T Say How Many Modes It Has And What Each Mode Is Used For..But It Mentions &#34;Modes&#34; Have Eight Gears?<Br /><Br />Here'S The &#34;Operation&#34; Instructions..Please Try To Decipher What It Means... And Yes I Know There'S Typos..But That Is How It Reads On The Instruction Manual...&#34;Each Mode Has Eight Gear, May Adjust The Intensity According To Your Needed. According To The Intermediate Key Open Product Cleaning Mode For The First Tiem. According To The Second Closed Products The Intensity Of Each Mode Can Be Though The + And - Buttons To Increase&#34;............Excuse Me What? Anyway ...<Br /><Br />Here Are My Instructions!!!<Br />1.) Charge The Unit To Full Before First Use. Flashing Means It'S Charging And When It Stops Blinking It Is Fully Charged.<Br /><Br />2.) Wet The Unit And Your Face, Apply Some Face Wash And Turn The Unit On To Cleanse Your Whole Face For 2 Minutes. This Unit Has 2 Modes, Cleanse And Massage. When You Press On The Button Between The - And + You Have It On Cleanse Mode (The Faster Vibration) And You Can Adjust The Vibration Intensity Higher Or Lower Depending On What You Prefer. When You Press The Middle Button Again It Turns Off ..When You Press It One More Time It Will Turn Onto The Massage Mode (Slower Vibration) You Can Adjust The Speed Of Vibration In This Mode As Well.<Br />  -The Unit Does Not Have A Self Timer So Don'T Expect This Unit To Shut Off After 2 Minutes Of Cleaning. It Also Says It Has &#34;Acoustic Cleaning&#34; Which I Thought Meant It Would Beep Every 30 Seconds Indicating You Should Move To Another Part Of Your Face (Ex. Left Cheek, Right Cheek, Chin And Then Forehead - Like The Clarisonic Does) But Does Not So You Need To Keep Track Of How Long You Want To Wash Your Face For With This.<Br /><Br />3) Shut The Unit Off When You'Re Finished By Clicking The Middle Button Between The - And +. Pat The Unit Dry Or Leave It Where It Can Air Dry.<Br /><Br />One Thing I Like About This Type Of Facial Brush Is That You Don'T Need To Replace Any Brush Heads On This Unit - It Makes For More Hygienic. This Styles Ii Facial Brush Also Claims To Reverse Signs Of Aging And Restoring Youth In Your Skin. I'M Only 27 So I Can'T Really Speak To This Claim, I Don'T Have May Wrinkles But I Hope This Is A Great Start For Preventative Measures.<Br /><Br />This Unit Also Claims To Be A Durable Travel Sized Facial Brush - It Feels Very Light Weight Which I Like Because I Don'T Want A Bulky Unit, I Really Like That The Cord Is Very Small And Doesn'T Need A Stand Charging Unit Like The Clarisonic. I Haven'T Used This Enough To Know How Long One Charge Can Hold But I'Ll Let You Know Once I Continue To Use This Consistently. Be Sure To Read The Instructions Because It Says You Need To Charge The Unit Fully Before Your First Use. When You Plug It In You Will See The Light At The Bottom To Start Flashing Indicating That It Is Actively Charging. I Hope This Unit Will Last Forever As It Claims - Wouldn'T That Be Amazing! :)<Br /><Br />I'Ve Already Used This Unit Last Night And I Can Say That My Face Felt Very Smooth And Clean Afterwards.

I haven't used this enough to know how long one charge can hold but I'll let you know once i continue to use this consistently. Be sure to read the instructions because it says you NEED to charge the unit fully before your first use.

"Comprehensive Review Of Robusta Coffee Scrub I Recently Used This Scrub And Felt Inspired To Write A Review About It For Those That Aren'T Sure If They Should Get This Scrub Or Not.<Br /><Br />Before Buying This Scrub, I Was Aware Coffee Scrubs Have Been Trending For A Year Or So.  As Others, I Was Very Skeptical About It And Wasn'T Sure How I Felt About This Beauty Trend. The Only Way I Was Going To Find Out Was To Give It A Try.<Br /><Br />Here'S What I Learned After Using It That I Think Will Help Others Should You Decide To Try It:<Br /><Br />1) Prepare Your Environment And Set Aside Time Before Using It - Prior To Using The Scrub, Decide Where You Are Going To Use It (Shower, Bath, Fenced Backyard, Etc.) Because I'M Warning You Now, It'S Gonna Get Messy. I Have A Regular Sized Shower/Bath, So If I Plan On Using This Again, I Would Get Myself Completely Wet, Sit In The Tub, Use The Scrub All Over My Body, Rinse Off (Still Sitting), Then Finally Stand Up To Complete Washing Off.  If You Have A Private Fenced Off Backyard Where You Are Near A Hose, That'S A Good Setting Too.  The Whole Process Took Approximately 40-50 Minutes (I Like To Take My Time). I Used The Whole Pack Because I Literally Used It All Over My Body, But You Can Use Whatever Amount You Want.  Just Know That You Will Need Time To Really Work It Into Your Skin And Let It Set For A Few Minutes Before Washing It Off.<Br /><Br />2) Be Honest With Yourself About Your Skin Regimen - What I Mean Is, If You Are Not Disciplined About Your Skin Regimen Or Don'T Want To Take Time To Use This Scrub, Then Honestly I Don'T Know This Product Is Going To Work For You. Personally, I'M Committed To A Regular And Consistent Skin Regimen And Set Aside Time To Use This Product To Get Optimal Results. I Am Just Saying This Isn'T Like A Typical Scrub And Takes More Time To Work It In To Your Skin.<Br /><Br />3) You'Ll Likely Need Soap To Get The Rest Of It Off - Even After A Rinse, It Will Stain, Just Like Coffee Will Do, So I Used Some Shea Butter Body Wash And A Body Brush To Get The Rest Of It Off.

My Skin Felt Very Smooth And Soft. That Being Said, I Bought It Without Having Any Expectations. I Tried It Mainly Out Of Curiosity. As There Are Advances In Beauty Products, I Am Naturally Going To Want To Try New Things. I Have Heard That Coffee Scrubs Reduce Cellulite Or Supports Regeneration Of New Skin Cells. Honestly I Don'T Know If That'S True And Frankly Find That Doubtful.  However, I Can Say It Is Better Than Most Scrubs I'Ve Used In The Past, And It'S A Wonderful Treat For The Skin From Time To Time. I Would Buy And Use It Again For Occasional Use.",nan,Ahmedabad,salon,4.0,"Comprehensive review of robusta coffee scrub I recently used this scrub and felt inspired to write a review about it for those that aren't sure if they should get this scrub or not.<br /><br />Before buying this scrub, I was aware coffee scrubs have been trending for a year or so. As others, I was very skeptical about it and wasn't sure how I felt about this beauty trend. The only way I was going to find out was to give it a try.<br /><br />Here's what I learned after using it that I think will help others should you decide to try it:<br /><br />1) Prepare your environment and set aside time before using it - Prior to using the scrub, decide where you are going to use it (shower, bath, fenced backyard, etc.) because I'm warning you now, it's gonna get messy. I have a regular sized shower/bath, so if I plan on using this again, I would get myself completely wet, sit in the tub, use the scrub all over my body, rinse off (still sitting), then finally stand up to complete washing off. If you have a private fenced off backyard where you are near a hose, that's a good setting too. The whole process took approximately 40-50 minutes (I like to take my time). I used the whole pack because I literally used it all over my body, but you can use whatever amount you want. Just know that you will need time to really work it into your skin and let it set for a few minutes before washing it off.<br /><br />2) Be honest with yourself about your skin regimen - What I mean is, if you are not disciplined about your skin regimen or don't want to take time to use this scrub, then honestly I don't know this product is going to work for you. Personally, I'm committed to a regular and consistent skin regimen and set aside time to use this product to get optimal results. I am just saying this isn't like a typical scrub and takes more time to work it in to your skin.<br /><br />3) You'll likely need soap to get the rest of it off - Even after a rinse, it will stain, just like coffee will do, so I used some shea butter body wash and a body brush to get the rest of it off. Once I was completely clean, I dried off and used body shop cocoa butter all over my body (it's what I usually use anyway).<br /><br />4) For people with very oily skin be aware - Since this product has coconut oil and you are highly prone to breaking out, I'm not sure if this is a good idea; the amount of coconut oil is definitely noticeable so just be aware.<br /><br />The verdict: I will say, this made me feel amazing afterwards. My skin felt very smooth and soft. That being said, I bought it without having any expectations. I tried it mainly out of curiosity. As there are advances in beauty products, I am naturally going to want to try new things. I have heard that coffee scrubs reduce cellulite or supports regeneration of new skin cells. Honestly I don't know if that's true and frankly find that doubtful. However, I can say it is better than most scrubs I've used in the past, and it's a wonderful treat for the skin from time to time. I would buy and use it again for occasional use.",3081,589

I know it was made for other types of makeup, but I already have a system for them; it was all my loose polishes that were driving me nuts. Please note that you won't get many full-size polishes to fit, though the Essie square type bottles make it easier to get as many in as possible. As you can see, I had to put some big bottles upside-down to fit more in. It still had room for my nail brushes, file, foils, tapes, glitters, and cotton balls in the bottom. The material is a very clear acrylic, but it doesn't feel too cheap. One complaint I have is the drawers can get a little stuck; but this is common with these acrylic drawers. Also, the top pc is separate from the bottom drawers, which I don't like. But these are all minor complaints. Overall, pleased it does the job.",1884,350

It was helpful for a few of the brushes, which I now use everyday.<br /><br />What I love:<br />*The sponges are fabulous for applying foundation and blending after you contour/highlight.<br />*The large, angled brush is great for applying blush, so it looks more natural.<br />*The large, pointed brush does a nice job, when adding bronzer to contour.<br />*The large, round brush is what I rely on for swirling on powder.<br />*The small, pointed brush is phenomenal at applying color at applying contour eye shadow.<br />* I use the small, tall bristled, rounded brush to blend the areas of shadow on my eyes that need softening.<br /><br />What I didn't like:<br />*Obviously, not knowing what each brush is for.<br />*The eyeshadow? brushes use too much product and application is sparse. I believe it's because the bristles are stiffer than what I usually use.<br />*No case to keep them clean, which leads me to look for alternative solutions. Leaving them out in the air, exposed, is a bad idea. Think of the germs in the air, especially if you keep them on the bathroom sink. Eww! Bacteria grows quickly and can cause infections, such as pink eye.<br />User Tip: I use baby shampoo to wash my brushes. It is gentle on your brushes and it gets the job done.<br />I received this product at a discount, in exchange for my honest feedback and unbiased review.",2602,457

I thought it might be a bad bottle but it's all of them that have any sparkle to them. After about 2 strokes on the mail it gets thick and stringy like old nail polish. Does not go on smooth or even. Not even after 2 coats. When using the step 2 top coat if your color isn't 100 percent dry it will pull the color off. It takes an incredibly long time to dry. And when your finally ready to remove....make sure you have time. I tried every method...leaving the cotton ball soaked on my nail for 3-5 minutes did little to speed the process. I had to file down the top coat to get the remover to penetrate and it still took tons of friction and remover to remove. It took me over 20 minutes just to remove the polish. The colors are gorgeous but it needs some work on the formula.,998,194

I Noticed That The Pad Was Turning Tan/Brownish Leading Me To Believe That These Pads Were Indeed Doing A Good Job Of Breaking Down Excess Junk On My Face (Despite A Good Cleansing) And Leaving My Skin Feeling Supple And Clean. I Followed The Directions That State To Pat In Any Excess Product. I Wasn'T Sure Whether To Follow Up With My Hydrating Toners, Or Skip To My Hyaluronic Acid (Ha).

Skin never ever tight, never irritated-- and I have non acne ROSACEA (flushing, telangiectasias/veins).<br /><br />I hadn't used the charcoal pads before, so I was excited to try them out. There are 60 pads in a tub with twist off lid. One side of the pad is quilted and you can clearly see the charcoal coloring. The other side is smooth. The pads are quite damp, and there is plenty of product on them to take care of face and neck, or to use as a targeted ""sheet mask"". Avoid eye area.<br /><br />DIRECTIONS: AFTER washing, swipe the quilted side over skin. Then use smooth side to pick up traces of impurities. Pat in remaining essence.<br /><br />When I swipe the quilted side over my skin, I like to go slow with gentle pressure. I allow the product to sit for a moment before flipping the pad over to the smooth side (more white than gray) and wipe my face. One side applies the product, the other helps to lift up what is left behind- or brought to surface as it is meant to draw out impurities and wastes. I noticed that the pad was turning tan/brownish leading me to believe that these pads were indeed doing a good job of breaking down excess junk on my face (despite a good cleansing) and leaving my skin feeling supple and clean. I followed the directions that state to pat in any excess product. I wasn't sure whether to follow up with my hydrating toners, or skip to my Hyaluronic Acid (HA). Since skin needs moisture to make HA most effective, I patted on one layer of hydrating toner, a layer of HA, followed by a moisturizer to help lock in the hydration. I think this charcoal pad is gentle enough to use daily, if need be. However, I have been using it 2-3x a week. You will have to experiment to see what is best for you. My 40 something rosacea skin is sensitive, leans dry, and loves hydration. My skin can use an occasional boost in really purifying my pores and such. I am really liking this product so far. It just feels so gentle on my skin!<br /><br />Benefits, and a little more info:<br /><br />--Charcoal powder and peeling essence ingredient- Hydroxycinnamic Acid- provide double synergy effect for absorbing sebum and removing dead skin cells. The charcoal powder delivers gentle yet effective adsorption benefit to draw impurities, while hypoallergenic peeling essence (Hydroxycinnamic Acid) provides manual exfoliation combined with chemical peeling effect.<br /><br />--Manual exfoliation + chemical peeling effect.<br />--With two sides including Charcoal pad that cleanses the skin and embossing pad that softly purifies the skin.<br /><br />--Pore clarifying: Formulated with natural Peat water and Charcoal powder(310 ppm), these help to draw deep-seated sebum, whiteheads, dead skin cells, and other impurities out of pores for smoother and clearer skin.<br /><br />--Gentle Peeling: NEOGEN PHA™ removes dead skin cells and impurities without irritation or discomfort while leaving the skin radiantly hydrated and smooth. Softly cleanses skin, non irritating.<br /><br />--Skin soothing: TECA™ formula (Titrated Extract of Centella Asiatica) delivers a soothing benefit to skin; helps create bright skin. Centella Asiatica has potent antioxidant properties, rich source of amino acids, and there's additional research showing that it's a good hydrating ingredient to soothe upset or compromised skin.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br />Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Betaine, Panthenol, Charcoal Powder(310ppm), Peat Water, Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiatic Acid, Acacia Senegal Gum, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Allantoin, Gluconolactone, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Glyceryl Caprylate, Tromethamine, Ethylhexylglycerin, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Xanthan Gum, Propanediol, Citric Acid, Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose, Alcohol, Rutin, Hydroxycinnamic Acid, Potassium Sorbate, Disodium EDTA",4395,692

"Simple To Use & Perfect Results Every Time!! I Love These Bun Makers!! I Have An Old Bun Maker That I'Ve Been Using For Years, But That One Just Got Tossed In The Trash Because These New Ones Are So Much Easier To Use And The Finished Product Looks Much Better!! These Bun Makers Are Unique In That They Are Foam, Which Helps To Grip Your Hair To Better Hold It In Place. They Also Have A Very Strong Inner Wire That Holds Them In Place In A Perfect Circle.

As You Roll The Hair Piece Upwards, Continue To Tuck Any Loose Ends In So That They Are Held In Place By The Rolled Hair.

"Well Made Unit This Is An Extremely Well-Made Unit And Appears Completely Waterproof.  It Charges In About An Hour With A Charge That Lasts Me Four Showers.

My hair is thick, but I can use them for the ends of my hair when I put my hair in a braid. I dont like them for pulling all my hair back. These won't be a repurchase. They're ""ok""",693,144

Just Bought My 2Nd Pack Of 3 Tubes So I Won’T Run Out Anytime Soon… This Is A Miracle Product For Severely Chapped Lips, And It’S Safe For Sensitive Skin!<Br /><Br />I Have Rosacea, And My Skin Is Extremely Sensitive. I’Ve Had To Stop Wearing Cosmetics, And My Skin Routine Has Felt Like A Part Time Job. I Also Have Several Allergies, And The Antihistamines I Have To Take Make My Skin/Lips Even More Dry. I’Ve Apparently Become Overly Sensitized To Ingredients In 95%+ Of Commercial Lip Balm Products, “Natural” Ingredients/Products. No Matter How Much Water I Drink, Very Healthy Diet, Hyaluronic Acid Supplements & Topical Hyaluronic Acid + Occlusives, Running A Humidifier, Staying Indoors, Etc., Nothing Has Helped The Severe, Painful Peeling Of My Lips For The Past 3-4 Years. It’S Been Embarrassing And Has Made Talking, Eating And Drinking An Uncomfortable And Painful.<Br /><Br />Everything I Tried Seemed To Make This Even Worse, So I Eventually Gave Up On Lip Balm. I Tried “Nothing,” (Just To See If I Actually Needed Lip Balm- That Was A Mistake!). I Resorted To Trying Single Ingredient Options, Just To Help Identify What The Problem Ingredient Might Be: Testing By Applying Only Straight Argan, Olive, Safflower Or Squalane Oils (Messy, Shiny, And Doesn’T Last Without An Occlusive Layer Added On Top), Straight Manuka Honey (Messy, Sticky, Expensive And Only Made Me Want To Lick My Lips All Day Lol). Made My Own Manuka Honey, Argan Oil And Beeswax Product (Worked Pretty Well But Oh So Messy, Time Consuming To Make).<Br /><Br />Finally Gave Up On That And Was Only Able To Use Vanicream Ointment (Dermatologist Recommended And Similar To Vaseline But Without The Petrochemical Odor- I Can’T Use Products Like Vaseline Or Aquaphor Fwiw). But Even That Wasn’T Working Well Because I Needed To Be So Careful Not To Apply Too Much, Or The Ointment Would Eventually  Migrate Onto My Face (Usually While Sleeping), Which Would Cause Rosacea Flares (Heavy Occlusives Seal In Moisture But Can Also Trap In Just Enough Heat To Cause A Rosacea Flare).<Br /><Br />But That Messy Solution That Only Stopped **Some** Of The Peeling Temporarily, And Never Resolved The Issue Entirely. Even Applying Every Hour On The Hour Didn’T Make Much Of A Difference.

"Flower Very Nice, But Birdcage Veil Difficult To Handle I Purchased This For My Upcoming Wedding.

The True Glow Eye Cream From Valentia Left A Protective Layer That Kept My Skin Looking Smoother Longer Through Out The Day. I Used The Product Twice A Day And Experienced Zero Irritations From Use. The Thin Layer Allowed For Make-Up Application After And No Odd Little Rolled Up Residue Balls Formed Hours Later, Or Worse, When Your Make-Up Separates Making It Look Like You Forgot To Blend. None Of That Happened! I Did Not Notice Fine Line Repair By Week Three, But I Can State That The Product Is Phenomenal Went It Comes To Working As A Prevention Aid.

The True Glow Eye Cream from Valentia left a protective layer that kept my skin looking smoother longer through out the day. I used the product twice a day and experienced zero irritations from use. The thin layer allowed for make-up application after and no odd little rolled up residue balls formed hours later, or worse, when your make-up separates making it look like you forgot to blend. None of that happened! I did not notice fine line repair by week three, but I can state that the product is phenomenal went it comes to working as a prevention aid. I looked more awake because the skin in that area was smooth and naturally plump, not swollen from my seasonal allergies! My eyes water at night and when I sleep, creating what I call &#34;teary eyes&#34;. I get red streaks from the irritation if I forget to apply eye cream or applied a poorly formulated one. I can state the Valentia's True Glow Eye cream prevented any red marks from setting in, so I woke up looking fresh and not like I have been weeping! This is an eye cream I would continue to use but also along with the Ultra Plumping Hydrating Mask from Valentia. These two products help each other out and I get a balanced appearance that is noticeable with this duo.<br /><br />I received the above product(s) free of charge from Valentia. I am not obligated to provide a positive or favorable review, just my honest opinion. My review is based on my experience with the product and/or brand, which may differ from yours.",3398,607

I wore this all day for Easter at the park (never thought I wouldn’t wear foundation to a family event!) & got tons of compliments how I look refreshed. I’m glowing & my skin hasn’t looked better! I will 100% be buying this for as long as they continue this product!<br /><br />2 MONTH UPDATE: Still am amazing product! Use it almost everyday now. I even tried it under my foundation& works wonderfully! I swear it made my foundation look better. Like others posted, the pumped stopped working on me. I now have to open the container to get the product out. Not that big of a deal but a bummer. But overall, will be purchasing again when I run out... which seems like a month or two more.",1498,281

It's a medium/light intensity and has sort of an after-shave smell to it. The scent does not linger much at all after rinsing. While I tend to prefer unscented soaps, this scent is pleasant and enjoyable.<br /><br />The only con is the bottle. Getting the pump nozzle to pop up was a chore since the retaining ring the pump head screws into also rotates, making it a struggle to get the nozzle to pop up. I eventually got it working, but have noticed that the pump leaks at the stem. It's a small leak, but it adds up over a few days to make a mess on the bottle and waste soap. Given the price, the pump mechanism should have been of better quality.<br /><br />One star down for the bottle issues, but otherwise, it's a very enjoyable soap to use.",1471,273

"Recommended I'Ve Been Very Happy With This Brush.  My Hair Has Always Been Thin, But Since It Has Started Getting More Gray, It Has Become More Dry & Coarse.

One Word Of Caution, The Nubs Are Very Hot, So You Can Put Your Hand Over Them, Also, Your Hair Will Be Warm For A Few Seconds After You Brush Thru It.

My hair has always been thin, but since it has started getting more gray, it has become more dry & coarse. I've been using a flat iron to smooth it out and get rid of the kinky nature. This has worked great for me instead. I wash it, dry it, and then just brush. One word of caution, the nubs are very hot, so you can put your hand over them, also, your hair will be warm for a few seconds after you brush thru it. I discovered I could use a dry wash cloth or heat resistant glove to assist in keeping my hair against the warming surface. As I place the brush under my hair & brush downward, I place my other hand (protected by cloth or glove) over the nubs, thereby holding the hair tight against the surface.

Each bottle of gel polish is nestled in a foam cradle. Black bottles cradled in black foam. Drametic.<br /> One con would be the lableing of whats inside the bottle. You have to open each little bottle to determind the acti\ual color. they are labled at the bottom . ie. CLo34?<br />I am a fan of gel nail polish, as properly apply can your nails remain hard as rocks, shinny as the day applyed and no chipping, At present my nails are 5 weeks and counting.<br />I garden, digging in plants nestled in greenhouses, as snow lay on the ground.<br />I am very hard ...no....extremely hard on nails. Until gel nail polish came into the home.<br />I digress, back to the labeling of the color of the nail polish. ( like swatching watercolors to evaluate color) The coloors are as follows Number one Clo90-A beautiful soft cloude like pink. Second color CLO34-Violet Third color CLO67 (The one is like ...would be a grey, soft and medium blue/grey...next CLO16 another cloud pink only a slightly medium humm two pinks? number five CLO11 medium wine..YAH! another grey but a shade bluer in tint.<br />I had to wait to try out the two greys .... why take off a 5 week polish....waiting...ok, the Gel nail greys.<br />Appled a very thin of polis, went on well, cured second coat of grey and one nail the second grey ...cured.. beautiful nail application...If, I say I can,<br />Waiting for q chip to appear. Nope! 4 weeks and still a beautiful nails .... while the nail remain hard ...your natural nails grow ..and grow. ..<br /><br />I did not take a trip to their web sight as I am pleased with but, they give you the entire procedure.

"Nice Cream, Gimmicky Packaging When I Opened This Package, I Had No Idea What I Was Looking At. Inside The Amazon Packaging Bag Was Another Bag, A Plastic Bag With A Bubble Wrap Lining And A Ziplock Type Zipper. Inside That, Was What Looked Like A Syringe. Honestly, I Was At First Convinced I Had The Wrong Order As I Had No Recollection Of Ordering Anything Matching What I Was Seeing. Upon Further Investigation, I Discovered It Was The Play Pretend Brand Of Under Eye Cream. Yes, The Amazon Product Page Does State The The Cream Comes In A Syringe-Like Tube, And Yes, It Does State That It Comes With A Skincare Travel Bag, This Wasn’T What I Had Envisioned.<Br />On To The Product…<Br />Once I Figured Out How To Open And Operate The Syringe (Hint: Remove The Large, Clear Cap, Remove The White Tip, Turn The Plunger To Unlock) To Dispense The Under Eye Cream, I Applied Some To My Face. The Scent Is Strong, Like Cucumber With An Underlying Perfume Smell. Not Unpleasant, But Kind Of Strong For Me, Someone Who Is Overly Sensitive To Scents. My Problem, I Know, And Most People Will Probably Really Enjoy The Scent. The Cream Is White, Smooth, Goes On Evenly And Is Absorbed Quickly. There Is A Bit Of A Cooling Sensation Which I Found Pleasant.<Br /><Br />The Travel Bag Seems Unnecessary To Me. It’S Really Not Much More Than A Heavy Ziplock Bag Lined With Bubble Wrap With A Large Logo Reading “Skin Set Go.”  If Someone Needs A Bag, Great, But I Have Several And I Don’T Think I’Ll Be Using This One.<Br /><Br />According To The Company’S Website, Skin Care Go Products Are Made In The Usa In Small Batches. Good. A Lot Of Natural Ingredients Go Into The Product, Which I Like, But The Complete List Of Ingredients From The Company’S Website Is As Follows:<Br /><Br />Water (Aqua), Carthamus Tinctorius Seed Oil, Polyacrylate-13, Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, Polyisobutene, Squalane, Sodium Hyaluronate, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopherol, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Butylene Glycol, Polysorbate 20, Acetyl Octapeptide-3, Caprylyl Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Fragrance, Yellow 5 (Ci 19140), Blue 1 (Ci 42090).<Br /><Br />The Final Verdict:<Br />The Product Is Nice, And While I’D Personally Prefer Something Less Heavily Scented, I Like The Way The Cream Works And What It Does For My Skin. It’S Very Hydrating And Brightening, With Nothing That Irritated My Skin. I Understand The Idea Behind The Syringe Dispenser: It’S Unique, It’S Fun, It’S Memorable. However, There’S A Ton Of Plastic Used That Isn’T Necessary, And With The Design, I Don’T Know How I’Ll Know When The Tube Is Nearing Empty.<Br />Overall, This Is A Good Product, Does What It Says It Does, And If You’Re Looking For Something A Little Unusual, Give It A Try.",nan,Ahmedabad,salon,4.0,"Nice cream, gimmicky packaging When I opened this package, I had no idea what I was looking at. Inside the Amazon packaging bag was another bag, a plastic bag with a bubble wrap lining and a ziplock type zipper. Inside that, was what looked like a syringe. Honestly, I was at first convinced I had the wrong order as I had no recollection of ordering anything matching what I was seeing. Upon further investigation, I discovered it was the Play Pretend brand of under eye cream. Yes, the Amazon product page does state the the cream comes in a syringe-like tube, and yes, it does state that it comes with a skincare travel bag, this wasn’t what I had envisioned.<br />On to the product…<br />Once I figured out how to open and operate the syringe (hint: remove the large, clear cap, remove the white tip, turn the plunger to unlock) to dispense the under eye cream, I applied some to my face. The scent is strong, like cucumber with an underlying perfume smell. Not unpleasant, but kind of strong for me, someone who is overly sensitive to scents. My problem, I know, and most people will probably really enjoy the scent. The cream is white, smooth, goes on evenly and is absorbed quickly. There is a bit of a cooling sensation which I found pleasant.<br /><br />The travel bag seems unnecessary to me. It’s really not much more than a heavy ziplock bag lined with bubble wrap with a large logo reading “Skin Set Go.” If someone needs a bag, great, but I have several and I don’t think I’ll be using this one.<br /><br />According to the company’s website, Skin Care Go products are made in the USA in small batches. Good. A lot of natural ingredients go into the product, which I like, but the complete list of ingredients from the company’s website is as follows:<br /><br />Water (Aqua), Carthamus Tinctorius Seed Oil, Polyacrylate-13, Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, Polyisobutene, Squalane, Sodium Hyaluronate, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopherol, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Butylene Glycol, Polysorbate 20, Acetyl Octapeptide-3, Caprylyl Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Fragrance, Yellow 5 (CI 19140), Blue 1 (CI 42090).<br /><br />The final verdict:<br />The product is nice, and while I’d personally prefer something less heavily scented, I like the way the cream works and what it does for my skin. It’s very hydrating and brightening, with nothing that irritated my skin. I understand the idea behind the syringe dispenser: it’s unique, it’s fun, it’s memorable. However, there’s a ton of plastic used that isn’t necessary, and with the design, I don’t know how I’ll know when the tube is nearing empty.<br />Overall, this is a good product, does what it says it does, and if you’re looking for something a little unusual, give it a try.",2855,475

Though i found these most useful when trying to get hair dye off of my neck. I have to dye my hair every 3 to 4 weeks because its fades so fast and i wind up with hair dye on my skin for a good week afterwards because it won't come off! I have tried nail polisher remover, soap and water, even makeup remover and they don't work that well. Now once these came in the mail, i tried them out and what do you know, they actually helped a lot. The wipe i used was full on pink when i got done!

"Feels Amazing But Pricey For Beloved One Melasleep Brightening Lumi'S Key Bio-Cellulose Facial Treatment Mask (33G X 1Pc)<Br /><Br />This Is An Impressive Gel Face Mask.  I Love The Feeling Of This Mask.  It’S A Heavy Gel Mask That Is Anything But Dry.  It’S Extremely Refreshing.<Br /><Br />I Will Say The Directions Are Brief.  When You Take It Out It’S Tri-Folded (The One Image Above Are The Two Outer Layers And The Mask Was In Between Those).  It Does Rip If You Aren’T Cautious With It.  There Are 3 Layers.  Once You Gently Unfold It You Peel Off The First Layer.  Then Apply To The Face And After Doing So Peel Off The Outside Cover.  It Is Much Easier If You Pull Out The Eye Holes And Mouth Hole Before Placing On Your Face.  It Does Have A Fair Amount Of Staying Power Once It’S In Place For A Minute.  Directions State To Leave It On For 10-15 Minutes.  I Left Mine On For Probably About 20 Minutes.<Br /><Br />The End Result Was Great.  My Skin Felt Clean, Rejuvenated, And Soft.  I Really Am Impressed With The Results Given My Hesitation To Try A Brand I Wasn’T Familiar With.  I Wish I Had More Of These Because I Would Love To Use Them On A Regular Basis But The Cost Is A Bit Unrealistic To Me.<Br /><Br />Thus The One Negative With This Mask.

Once you gently unfold it you peel off the first layer. Then apply to the face and after doing so peel off the outside cover. It is much easier if you pull out the eye holes and mouth hole before placing on your face. It does have a fair amount of staying power once it’s in place for a minute. Directions state to leave it on for 10-15 minutes. I left mine on for probably about 20 minutes.<br /><br />The end result was great. My skin felt clean, rejuvenated, and soft. I really am impressed with the results given my hesitation to try a brand I wasn’t familiar with. I wish I had more of these because I would love to use them on a regular basis but the cost is a bit unrealistic to me.<br /><br />Thus the one negative with this mask. The price point is very steep. I’ve had many masks that worked very well for much less. Now I did have a particularly great result from this mask so don’t get me wrong it may very well be worth the money to some. I’m just not one of those people that could justify it to myself. However, I do love the feeling I have after using it. I am not going to knock the product rating for the price point because that is really the only thing that I don’t like here. The product itself is really good and I’m happy with the results. I would just reiterate that the listing is for a single mask.",1833,350

I assumed it was due to a niacin conversion on my skin, but after a couple weeks, I started breaking out more than ever. I noticed that my skin was completely sensitive, red, and everything would sting my face. I did not think it was this product at first, but after i stopped using this product completely, the redness and sensitivity stopped.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />Do not buy this product. In my case, this product made my skin worse than it has ever been along with being super crazy sensitive. I do not recommend this to anyone, but perhaps I received a bad batch? The lot/manufacturing stamp on the product is ""8LB"" if anyone with the same lot/manufacturing stamp is having a similar issue...<br />However, if you are looking for a niacinamide+zinc formula, I would recommend Revolution Skincare Niacinamide+Zinc from Ulta instead. I have now been using that for about 3 weeks without any of the same issues from the Ordinary.",1599,280

Mature Adults Usually Have Tougher Skin From Loss Of Collagen, Sun Degradation, And For Simply Having Shaved Many 1,000'S Of Times.

Look For Cvs In-Store At Your Local Branch Then Check Amazon To Ensure You Find The Lowest Cost.",nan,Ahmedabad,salon,5.0,"Low cost, quality OEM replacement SUMMARY:<br />I found these blades to be a much lower cost, good-excellent quality alternative to stock Gillette blades.<br /><br />MAINTENANCE? Note, however, I always perform proper cleaning maintenance after each shave. To wit: I brush off the blades using the tooth brush bristles to get in between the blades, then blow on it a few times to clear off most of any remaining water droplets. This greatly retards oxidation and corrosion of the blade edges. For anyone groaning right now, that &#34;whole big process&#34; takes all of 10 seconds! That's fast by any measure.<br /><br />LIFE:<br />Using the above standard methodology of use, I got just as long a use per blade as stock Gillette's ... roughly 2 months per blade .. before there is a any hint of snagging, rather than cutting, my hairs.<br /><br />FEEL:<br />I found the slightly larger size of the blade head felt a bit odd but only on the very 1st shave. It soon felt good, even reassuring, as it provided a broader surface to go over my skin.<br /><br />CUTS?<br />One reviewer said they cut him easily. I, too, have been cut, but it was by the stock Gillette blades. Frankly, it's going to happen with any blade ... eventually. Some units of any make blades will be slightly off on rare occasion or have inconsistent edges than can cut or scratch. Then, there's the matter of user technique.<br /><br />After 4-5 decades on this earth, a shaver should get a sense of their skin hairs, how they slant, how sensitive the skin is underneath, and, most importantly, how tough their skin has become. These things are even more critical for women who are forced to shave areas infinitely more sensitive than those of men. Mature adults usually have tougher skin from loss of collagen, sun degradation, and for simply having shaved many 1,000's of times. Younger shavers tend to have sensitive skin and are less attuned to the proper angles at which to pull the shaver to deal with their skin profile.<br /><br />I took the above side trip to highlight that for some, the minutest difference in blades could cause some shavers to cut themselves - not necessarily due to blade defects or construction style but, perhaps, simply because they have not spent as much time adapting their technique to a new blade as they did to their previous one. That is, days or weeks versus many years! Remember how many times new shavers cut themselves when 1st shaving? The same experiential curve applies to those changing blade models - not matter their age or shaving experience level.<br /><br />VALUE:<br />So far, for me, these low cost blades are a tremendous value. Plus I bought a 5 pack for $0.97 on a 1-time CVS sale. Then bought another at the regular (way cheaper than OEM) price of $16 for 10. So, I'm good for another 1.25 years at 2 months per blade.<br /><br />COST PER SHAVE:<br />Excluding the clearance price I got on a 5-pack, the $16 price for 10 = $1.60 each. With a mean time to replacement of 2 months (for me), that equates to $1.60 / 60 days = $0.0267 cents per shave or roughly $0.81 / month or $9.74 / year.<br /><br />BLADE AGING PROFILE:<br />The &#34;newness&#34; feeling and sharpness wore off at about the same rate as do my Gillette blades.<br />To wit: 1-5 shaves = feels like new using 2-3 strokes/pass<br /> 5-20 = 3-4 strokes/pass<br />20-40 = 4-5 strokes/pass<br />40-60 = 5-6 strokes/pass<br />Only then do I toss and replace unless, of course, I come upon a blade that seems to have aged quicker for whatever reason.<br /><br />CONCLUSION:<br />They look, feel, and age not much differently than Gillette blades and cost 50-75% less. Look for CVS in-store at your local branch then check Amazon to ensure you find the lowest cost.",3753,653
"Amazing Product! I Waited To Write A Review On This Product Because, At First, I Was Not Sure About It.  The Product Is Well Packaged And Easy To Use.  I Am 54 Years Old And After The First Night I Used It, I Woke Up The Next Morning And My Face Was Red And A Bit Swollen.  At First I Thought Maybe I Was Having An Allergic Reaction.  I Noticed After One Use My Skin Was Much Smoother, As If The Top Layer Of Dead Skin Came Off.  I Gave My Face A Few Days Of A Break, As This Product Seems To Be A Strong One, And Reluctantly Tried It Again.  I Did Not Have The Same Reaction With The Redness And Swelling.  So I Kept Using This Product, But As It Is A Strong One, I Use It Only 2-3 Times A Week.  After About A Couple Of Weeks Using It, I Discovered All Kinds Of Undesirable Things Coming Out Of The Pores Of My Skin, I Developed Little Pussy Sores And Pimples, But The Pimples Were Not Like The Regular Pimple, These Were Deep And What Came Out Was Really Think And Sometimes Hard.  Instead Of Having What I Thought Was An Allergic Reaction, I Think This Product Was Pulling Impurities Out Of My Skin And Detoxing It.  I Also Had A Couple Of Small, Sebaceous Cysts On My Forehead And After About A Month Of Using This Product, They Were Gone!  I Was Told By A Plastic Surgeon The Only Way To Get Rid Of Them Was Surgery But I Didn'T Want The Scar On My Forehead So Never Had Anything Done About Them, I Had Them For Years.  To This Day, The Cysts Are Gone.  My Skin No Longer Reacts As If Impurities Are Being Pulled Out.  There Is Still A Small Amount Of Burning On The Nights I Use This Product But If I Follow It Up With Argon Oil Or Rose Hip Oil, The Burning Goes Away.  I'Ve Noticed My Skin Is A Firmer, Smoother In Texture, Very Soft, And The Skin Tone Is More Even.  Although I Got Amazing Results, This Product May Be Overpriced Considering It Is Only Ascorbic Acid.  Maybe The Products In The Activator Justifies The Price But As I'M Not An Expert On Ingredients, I'M Not Sure.",nan,Bangalore,salon,5.0,"Amazing Product! I waited to write a review on this product because, at first, I was not sure about it. The product is well packaged and easy to use. I am 54 years old and after the first night I used it, I woke up the next morning and my face was red and a bit swollen. At first I thought maybe I was having an allergic reaction. I noticed after one use my skin was much smoother, as if the top layer of dead skin came off. I gave my face a few days of a break, as this product seems to be a strong one, and reluctantly tried it again. I did not have the same reaction with the redness and swelling. So I kept using this product, but as it is a strong one, I use it only 2-3 times a week. After about a couple of weeks using it, I discovered all kinds of undesirable things coming out of the pores of my skin, I developed little pussy sores and pimples, but the pimples were not like the regular pimple, these were deep and what came out was really think and sometimes hard. Instead of having what I thought was an allergic reaction, I think this product was pulling impurities out of my skin and detoxing it. I also had a couple of small, sebaceous cysts on my forehead and after about a month of using this product, they were gone! I was told by a plastic surgeon the only way to get rid of them was surgery but I didn't want the scar on my forehead so never had anything done about them, I had them for years. To this day, the cysts are gone. My skin no longer reacts as if impurities are being pulled out. There is still a small amount of burning on the nights I use this product but if I follow it up with argon oil or rose hip oil, the burning goes away. I've noticed my skin is a firmer, smoother in texture, very soft, and the skin tone is more even. Although I got amazing results, this product may be overpriced considering it is only ascorbic acid. Maybe the products in the activator justifies the price but as I'm not an expert on ingredients, I'm not sure.",1971,389

It probably has good stay power.<br /><br />The Cons: By far the biggest for me is that the teeth are spaced much more widely apart and are much thicker than I expected from the photo. This means you can't really get the curl definition that the picks with a more narrow spacing will give you. I also wish the handle were a bit longer.",1002,192

"Did Not Work For Me Let Me Begin This Review By Stating That I Have Been Using Egyptian, Indian And Pakistani 100% Henna For Over 30 Years With Beautiful Results That Lasted A Full 3 Months.

I Did A Bit Of Research, By The Way, And Learned That Most Henna/Indigo Distributors, Unlike Harvest Moon, Suggest Mixing Up The Henna And Indigo Powders Separately And Then Combining.  Based On My Experience, I'D Have To Say This Would Probably Work Better (The Rationale Probably Being The Same As Why Combining Shampoo And Conditioner Together Don'T Work As Well As Shampooing And Then Conditioning).

"Best Peeling Kit I'Ve Tried So Far This Is The 3Rd Peel Foot Mask That I Have Tried. The Others Have Been Unsuccessful. Still Wanting To Experience The Foot Peel, I Tried Again. The First Thing That Makes This Foot Peel Better Than The Others Is The Foot Slippers. The Slippers Are Actually A Medium Thickness Plastic.

The 2 Slippers Were Attached Together At The Top. So I Cut Them Apart And Then I Had To Snip A Little Off The Top To Open Up Where My Foot Was To Go Inside. This Foot Peel Has A Somewhat Pleasant Scent. I Was Worried Because One Of The Ingredients Is Vinegar And Another Is Fermented Milk. Those Did Not Sound Appealing At All. However, What I Smelled Was A Combination Of The Ginger And The Chamomile. The Hardest Thing About This Whole Process Was Carving Out The Time To Do It.

As I age I don’t mind the wrinkles or even the age spots. What I do mind is my sagging skin. Yes, having jowls terrifies me. This Star Mask was more comfortable than I thought it would be. You put a layer on and let it set between 20-30 minutes until it is completely dry. Usually, I can only stand to wear a mask 10 minutes, but this mask was so comfortable that I dozed off with it on. I woke up just in time to remove.<br /><br />Removal was a little difficult and made me wonder how tugging on my skin actually helped with firming, toning, and lifting. I’ve only had a chance to try this mask once so I cannot say that it’s going to keep the jowls at bay. What positive results I did have was my face was so soft and bright after removing this mask. Best of all my overly sensitive skin wasn’t irritated in the least. It is a mask that I am going to incorporate into my skincare routine and hopefully, the jowls never appear. You need such a small amount of this mask that the 1.7 fl oz jar should last you through many maskings. Also, the jar is so pretty it can sit on your vanity and no one will be the wiser that you have a black glittery gel inside.<br /><br />The only thing I didn’t like was the glitter was uncomfortable during application. Some of the larger sized glitters would catch and scratch your skin until they laid down. Not to the point of marks or blood. Just an annoyance.<br /><br />I received this product for free or at a reduced price for testing purposes. .",1586,306
